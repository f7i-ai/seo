  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, photo-realistic wide shot of a modern industrial manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse team of three maintenance professionals—two men and one woman—are standing near a large, complex centrifugal pump system. They are wearing clean, professional PPE including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility yellow vests over work shirts. One technician is pointing toward a specific component of the pump while the others look on, engaged in a collaborative discussion. They are shown from the waist up or full body. One technician holds a ruggedized industrial tablet, but only the back of the device is visible to the camera. The background shows a clean, well-lit factory floor with various pipes, motors, and overhead conveyors, all in sharp focus with a professional depth of field. No text or logos are visible on the equipment or clothing.",
