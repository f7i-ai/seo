  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern industrial manufacturing facility or mining operation. In the foreground, a reliability technician wearing a hard hat, safety glasses, and high-visibility vest is inspecting a large conveyor belt pillow block bearing. The technician is using a handheld ultrasonic device (seen from the back/side, focusing on the hardware form factor) with a coiled cable connecting to heavy-duty industrial headphones over their ears. They are holding a grease gun but are paused, listening intently. The background shows the depth of the facility with the conveyor belt stretching into the distance, slightly out of focus to emphasize the technician and the bearing. The lighting is industrial but dramatic, highlighting the texture of the machinery and the PPE. No text or overlays in the image.",
