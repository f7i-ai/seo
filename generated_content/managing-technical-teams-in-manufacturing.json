  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern, clean manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance technicians (men and women of varying ages) are gathered for a morning stand-up meeting. They are wearing professional PPE: hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One technician is holding a rugged tablet (back of device visible) pointing toward a large industrial machine, while the manager (a distinct figure, perhaps in a different color vest) listens intently. The background features blurred automated conveyor belts and robotic arms, suggesting a high-tech environment. The lighting is bright and industrial, with a cool blue hue emphasizing technology and cleanliness. No text or words in the image.",
