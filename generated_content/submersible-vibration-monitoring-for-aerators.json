  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern wastewater treatment plant. In the foreground, a reliability engineer wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-visibility vest is crouching near a safety railing, looking at a tablet (screen not visible) held in one hand. The engineer is inspecting a junction box mounted on the railing. In the background, large aeration basins are visible with turbulent, bubbling water. A crane is visible in the far distance, implying maintenance operations. The lighting is industrial but dramatic, highlighting the contrast between the calm engineer and the chaotic water.
