  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern Australian manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance engineers (men and women) are wearing high-visibility vests, hard hats, and safety glasses. One engineer is holding a rugged tablet, but the screen is not visible (showing the back of the device). They are looking at a large industrial motor and pump assembly that has small, wireless orange sensors attached to the cooling fins. The background shows a clean, busy production line with blurred motion of conveyors. The lighting is professional and industrial, with a mix of cool LED factory lighting and warm highlights on the machinery. No text or words in the image. 8k resolution.",
