  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot of a modern Coal Handling and Preparation Plant (CHPP) in Queensland, Australia, during the \"golden hour\" of sunset. The industrial structure is complex, with conveyors, cyclones, and steel gantries. In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (one female, two male) are conducting an inspection. They are wearing full mining compliance PPE: high-visibility orange and navy reflective shirts, hard hats, safety glasses, and gloves. One engineer is holding a ruggedized tablet, showing the back of the device (no screen visible), pointing toward a conveyor motor. The lighting highlights the dust-free, organized nature of a well-maintained site. No text or overlays. 8k resolution, highly detailed industrial photography style.",
