In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers (wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests) are inspecting a large industrial conveyor belt system. One engineer is holding a tablet (screen hidden from view) pointing towards a motor, while another points at a specific section of the belt. The background shows a clean, well-lit factory floor with blurred automated machinery. The lighting is dramatic, highlighting the texture of the industrial equipment and the professionalism of the team. No text or overlays. 16:9 aspect ratio.",
