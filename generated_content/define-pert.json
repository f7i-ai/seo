  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern but active \"brownfield\" manufacturing plant. In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance engineers (men and women, various ethnicities) are gathered around a large industrial workbench. They are wearing full PPE: hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One engineer is pointing to a digital tablet (back of device visible only) held by another, while a third references a printed schematic on the table. In the background, blurred slightly to create depth, are heavy industrial conveyors and large motor assemblies. The lighting is a mix of cool industrial LED and warm task lighting, creating a professional, high-tech atmosphere. No text or words should be visible in the image. The mood conveys collaboration, precision, and modern technology integration.",
