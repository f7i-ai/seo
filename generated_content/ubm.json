  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, professional photograph of a modern industrial manufacturing floor. In the foreground, a diverse pair of maintenance professionals (one man, one woman) are collaborating. They are wearing full PPE, including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility yellow vests over work shirts. One professional is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet, but only the back of the device is visible to the camera. They are standing near a large, clean industrial motor and pump assembly that has small, non-obtrusive sensors attached to it. The background shows a well-lit, organized factory environment with conveyor lines and other machinery, slightly out of focus to emphasize the technicians. The lighting is bright and natural, conveying a sense of efficiency and advanced technology. No text or logos are visible. Full-body shot showing the technicians in their working environment.",
