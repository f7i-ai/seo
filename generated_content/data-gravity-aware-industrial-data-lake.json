  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, cinematic shot inside a modern, high-tech manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers and OT specialists (wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests) are gathered around a large industrial turbine. One engineer is holding a ruggedized tablet (back facing the camera) while pointing at a physical edge gateway device mounted on the machine. The background features blurred, automated production lines with cool blue and metallic tones. The lighting is professional and dramatic, highlighting the convergence of physical machinery and digital technology. No text or overlays.",
