  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern, clean manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance technicians (men and women of various ethnicities) are gathered around a large industrial machine. They are wearing full PPE including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One technician is holding a ruggedized tablet, showing the back of the device to the camera (screen hidden), while pointing at a component on the machine, seemingly discussing a procedure. The background shows blurred production lines and digital dashboards on the walls. The lighting is professional industrial lighting, cool tones with warm accents on the machinery. No text or words should be visible in the image.",
