  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, high-quality professional image for a manufacturing blog post. In a bright, clean, modern factory setting, two maintenance professionals, a woman with dark hair in a ponytail and a man of South Asian descent, both wearing blue hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests, are inspecting a large industrial pump.
