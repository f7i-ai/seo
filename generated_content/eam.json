  "image_prompt": "A hyper-realistic, cinematic wide shot of a modern manufacturing facility interior. The scene features a diverse group of maintenance engineers and operations managers (men and women of various ethnicities) wearing standard PPE including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. They are standing near a large, complex industrial machine (like a conveyor system or large pump), looking at a tablet held by one of the engineers (only the back of the tablet is visible). The lighting is professional and industrial, with cool blue tones accented by warm safety lighting. The environment looks clean but active (\"brownfield\" modern), with visible pipes, sensors attached to motors, and steel structures. No text or words should be visible in the image. The atmosphere conveys collaboration, technology, and efficiency.",
