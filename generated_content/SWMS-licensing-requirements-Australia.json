  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-quality image set in a modern Australian industrial manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance technicians (men and women) are gathered around a large piece of industrial machinery. They are wearing full PPE including hard hats, high-visibility vests with reflective strips, safety glasses, and steel-capped boots. One technician is holding a rugged tablet, showing the screen to a supervisor; the screen is not clearly visible but implies a digital workflow. The background is slightly blurred but shows a clean, organized factory floor with yellow safety walkways and lockout/tagout stations. The lighting is bright and professional, emphasizing a culture of safety and compliance. No text or words should be visible in the image.",
