  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance technicians (men and women) are wearing safety gear (hard hats, safety glasses, high-vis vests). One technician is viewed from behind, holding a rugged tablet; the screen is not visible, but they are looking up at a large industrial conveyor system. The background shows a mix of heavy machinery with subtle, modern sensors attached to motors. The lighting is professional industrial lighting with a slight cool blue tint to emphasize technology. No text or words in the image. The atmosphere conveys efficiency, safety, and modern technology integration.",
