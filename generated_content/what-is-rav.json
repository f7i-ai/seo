  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, professional photo of a diverse team of three maintenance professionals—two men and one woman—standing in a modern, clean industrial manufacturing facility. They are wearing full PPE, including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility neon vests. One person is holding a rugged industrial tablet (viewed from the back, no screen visible), while the others are looking at a large, complex piece of machinery (a series of pumps and motors) in the background. The lighting is bright and natural, highlighting the metallic textures of the equipment. The shot is a medium-full body shot, showing the clean floor and the scale of the plant. No text or logos are visible in the image. Professional, authoritative, and forward-looking atmosphere.\n\n---\n**External References for Citation:**\n*   [SMRP Best Practices and Metrics](https://www.smrp.org)\n*   [ISO 55000 Asset Management Standards](https://www.iso.org/standard/55088.html)",
