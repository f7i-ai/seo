In the foreground, a stainless steel electric motor (shiny, clean design) is mounted on a conveyor belt system. Attached to the motor is a small, glowing industrial IoT sensor. In the background, slightly out of focus, a reliability engineer wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-visibility vest is inspecting a tablet (back of tablet visible only). The environment is clean, metallic, and industrial, with hints of steam or moisture in the air to suggest a washdown environment. Professional lighting, 8k resolution.",
