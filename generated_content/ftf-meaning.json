  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, professional photograph of a diverse maintenance team in a modern industrial manufacturing plant. A female maintenance manager in a white hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-visibility orange vest is standing next to a male technician in a blue uniform and a yellow hard hat. They are standing in front of a large, complex piece of industrial machinery (a series of pumps and motors with visible sensors). The manager is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet, showing only the back of the device to the camera. The technician is holding a professional wrench. Both are looking at the machine with a focused, collaborative expression. The background is slightly blurred, showing a clean, well-lit \"brownfield\" factory environment with other machinery and safety markings on the floor. The lighting is bright and natural, emphasizing a professional and efficient atmosphere. Full-body shot, no text or overlays.",
