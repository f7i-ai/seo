  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot of a modern oil and gas refinery at twilight, blending industrial complexity with high-tech reliability. In the foreground, a reliability engineer wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, and high-visibility coveralls stands with their back partially to the camera, looking out at the complex of pipes and distillation columns. They are holding a ruggedized industrial tablet in one hand (screen not visible) and a vibration sensor device in the other. The background features towering refinery structures with safety lighting glowing amber and white against a deep blue dusk sky. Subtle digital overlay elements (like faint wireframe schematics or data nodes) are integrated into the air around the pipes to symbolize the \"Digital Twin\" or IoT connectivity, but kept realistic and not cartoonish. The atmosphere is professional, serious, and focused on technology and safety.",
