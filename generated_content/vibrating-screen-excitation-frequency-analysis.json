  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, cinematic shot inside a modern industrial mineral processing plant or quarry. The focus is on a large, yellow or orange industrial vibrating screen (shaker) in operation. A reliability engineer, wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-visibility vest, is standing safely to the side of the machine. They are holding a tablet (back of device visible) and looking at the machine, appearing to compare data on the screen with the physical equipment. The background is slightly blurred but shows conveyor belts and steel structures. The lighting is industrial but dramatic, highlighting the motion of the screen and the dust-free, organized nature of a modern facility. No text overlays.",
