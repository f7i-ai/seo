In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are collaborating. They are wearing clean, professional PPE including white hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One technician is pointing toward a large industrial mixer, while another holds a ruggedized tablet (shown from the back, no screen visible). The environment is a \"brownfield\" site, showing a mix of sturdy, older mechanical equipment and modern, clean sensor wiring. The lighting is bright and industrial, emphasizing a clean and safe workspace. Full-body shots of the workers, showing them standing on a polished concrete floor with yellow safety markings.
