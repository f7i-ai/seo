In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers (men and women) wearing standard mining PPE (orange high-vis vests, hard hats with ear muffs attached, safety glasses) are looking at a ruggedized tablet held by one of them (back of tablet visible only). They are standing near a large conveyor belt system. In the background, massive crushing equipment and yellow haul trucks are visible in the distance. The lighting is a mix of natural sunlight and industrial LED lighting. Superimposed subtly in the air near the machinery are holographic-style data visualizations (graphs, heatmaps) representing the \"digital twin\" aspect, but kept realistic and not overly sci-fi. The atmosphere is professional, high-tech, and industrial.",
