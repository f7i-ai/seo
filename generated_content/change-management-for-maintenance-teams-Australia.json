  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-quality hero image set inside a modern Australian manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance technicians (men and women) are wearing standard Australian high-visibility workwear (orange/navy) with reflective strips, hard hats, and safety glasses. They are gathered around a large industrial motor and conveyor belt system. One technician is holding a rugged tablet (back of device visible only) pointing toward a sensor on the machine, while an older senior technician points at the machine, explaining a concept to the group. The background shows a clean, busy factory floor with blurred machinery. The lighting is bright and industrial. The mood is collaborative, professional, and focused on safety and technology. No text or overlays in the image.",
