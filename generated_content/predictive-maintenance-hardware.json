  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern, clean manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a reliability engineer wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-visibility vest is inspecting a large industrial electric motor. The engineer is looking at the motor, where a small, wireless industrial sensor (orange or yellow casing) is mounted. In the blurred background, other automated machinery and conveyors are visible, with soft blue and cool industrial lighting. The image conveys technology, precision, and industrial safety. No text or screens visible.",
