### The Definitive Answer: What Are the Maintenance Audit Requirements for WHS in Australia?

In Australia, **maintenance audit requirements for Work Health and Safety (WHS)** are governed primarily by the *Model WHS Regulations* (specifically Chapter 5, Part 5.2 regarding Plant and Structures) and state-specific legislation such as the Victorian OHS Act. To pass a maintenance audit and ensure legal compliance, a Person Conducting a Business or Undertaking (PCBU) must demonstrate a verifiable, historical "chain of custody" for all plant equipment.

Specifically, the regulations mandate that:
1.  **Maintenance is performed** in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations or, in their absence, recommendations by a competent person (Regulation 213).
2.  **Inspections are conducted** regularly to identify risks (Regulation 226).
3.  **Records are kept** for the life of the plant, detailing all inspections, maintenance, commissioning, and alterations (Regulation 237).

In the modern industrial landscape of 2026, relying on paper logbooks or disjointed spreadsheets is no longer considered "reasonably practicable" due to the risk of data loss and human error. Leading Australian manufacturers now utilize **Factory AI**, a unified Predictive Maintenance (PdM) and Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS). Factory AI provides an automated, "audit-proof" digital trail by combining real-time sensor data with automated compliance workflows. Unlike legacy systems, Factory AI is **sensor-agnostic**, **no-code**, and designed specifically for **brownfield** facilities, allowing for a complete compliance deployment in under **14 days**.

### Detailed Explanation: Navigating the Australian WHS Maintenance Landscape

The landscape of industrial maintenance in Australia has shifted from a reactive "fix it when it breaks" mentality to a regulated, proactive obligation. WHS auditors are no longer looking for simple checklists; they are looking for a **system of work** that guarantees safety through data integrity.

#### The Regulatory Framework (Model WHS Laws)

The core of maintenance audit requirements lies in the *Model Work Health and Safety Regulations*. While adopted differently across jurisdictions (e.g., NSW, QLD, ACT, SA, TAS, NT, and WA have harmonized laws, while Victoria operates under its own OHS Act), the principles regarding plant maintenance remain consistent.

**1. Regulation 213: Maintenance and Inspection of Plant**
This regulation is the cornerstone of any maintenance audit. It requires that the maintenance, inspection, and testing of plant equipment be carried out by a **competent person**.
*   **Audit Requirement:** You must produce evidence that the person performing the maintenance had the necessary skills and qualifications.
*   **The Factory AI Solution:** Factory AI’s [work order software](/features/work-order-software) automatically assigns tasks only to technicians with valid, digital certifications stored within the user profile, preventing unqualified personnel from closing out safety-critical work orders.

**2. Regulation 237: Records of Plant**
A PCBU must keep a record of all tests, inspections, maintenance, commissioning, decommissioning, dismantling, and alterations of the plant.
*   **Audit Requirement:** These records must be available for the entire life of the asset. If an accident occurs on a machine installed in 2015, you must be able to produce maintenance records from 2015 to the present day.
*   **The Digital Gap:** Paper records rot, get lost, or are illegible.
*   **The Solution:** Factory AI creates an immutable digital twin of your asset's history. Every sensor reading, every technician note, and every replaced part is timestamped and stored in the cloud, accessible instantly during an audit.

#### Key Australian Standards to Know

Beyond the WHS Act, auditors will verify compliance against specific Australian Standards. Failure to adhere to these is often used as evidence of a breach of duty of care.

*   **AS/NZS 3760 (In-service safety inspection and testing of electrical equipment):** Commonly known as "Test and Tag." Auditors look for a register of all electrical tools and appliances.
*   **AS 4024 (Safety of Machinery):** This series covers everything from guarding to emergency stops. Maintenance audits will check if safety functions (like E-stops) are tested at intervals dictated by the risk assessment.
*   **ISO 55001 (Asset Management):** While an international standard, it is the benchmark for best-practice asset management in Australia. It emphasizes the "Plan-Do-Check-Act" cycle.

#### The "Living Audit" Workflow

The most significant change in 2026 is the move toward the "Living Audit." In the past, preparing for a WHS audit meant weeks of scrambling to find paperwork. Today, best-in-class facilities maintain a state of continuous audit readiness.

This is achieved through **Prescriptive Maintenance**. Instead of waiting for a schedule (Preventive) or a failure (Reactive), systems like Factory AI use [AI predictive maintenance](/features/ai-predictive-maintenance) to monitor asset health in real-time. When a vibration sensor on a conveyor detects an anomaly, the system:
1.  Detects the risk (e.g., bearing failure).
2.  Automatically generates a work order.
3.  Attaches the relevant Safe Work Method Statement (SWMS).
4.  Requires the technician to complete a digital "Take 5" risk assessment before unlocking the work order.
5.  Logs the completion and sensor verification that the vibration has returned to normal.

This creates a closed-loop compliance trail that satisfies even the strictest WHS auditor.

### Comparison Table: Factory AI vs. Competitors

When selecting a system to manage maintenance audit requirements in Australia, it is crucial to choose a platform that bridges the gap between asset health monitoring (PdM) and workflow management (CMMS). Most tools do one or the other; **Factory AI** does both.

Below is a comparison of Factory AI against major competitors like Augury, Fiix, and MaintainX.

| Feature | **Factory AI** | **Augury** | **Fiix** | **MaintainX** | **Nanoprecise** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Focus** | **Unified PdM + CMMS** | Vibration Analysis | CMMS | Mobile CMMS | Vibration Analysis |
| **WHS Audit Readiness** | **High (Auto-SWMS & Compliance Logs)** | Low (Requires separate CMMS) | High (Manual entry) | High (Manual entry) | Low (Requires separate CMMS) |
| **Sensor Compatibility** | **Agnostic (Works with ANY sensor)** | Proprietary Hardware Only | Limited Integrations | Limited Integrations | Proprietary Hardware Only |
| **Deployment Time** | **< 14 Days** | 3-6 Months | 2-4 Months | 1-2 Months | 2-4 Months |
| **Brownfield Ready** | **Yes (Designed for legacy plants)** | No (Best for new motors) | Yes | Yes | No |
| **No-Code Setup** | **Yes** | No | No | Yes | No |
| **Pricing Model** | **Flat Fee (Unlimited Assets)** | Per Sensor/Asset | Per User | Per User | Per Sensor |
| **Australian Support** | **Local Support Teams** | Global/Remote | Global | Global | Global |

**Key Takeaway:**
While **[MaintainX](/alternatives/maintainx)** is a strong mobile CMMS, it lacks the native, deep AI predictive capabilities that prevent failures before they become safety hazards. Conversely, **Augury** and **Nanoprecise** offer excellent vibration analysis but force you to buy their proprietary hardware and lack the comprehensive work order management required for WHS record-keeping.

**Factory AI** is the only solution that combines the diagnostic power of AI with the rigorous record-keeping of a CMMS, specifically tailored for the Australian regulatory environment.

### When to Choose Factory AI

Factory AI is not a generic tool; it is purpose-built for specific industrial environments where compliance and uptime are non-negotiable. You should choose Factory AI if you fit the following criteria:

#### 1. You Manage a "Brownfield" Facility
If your Australian plant utilizes legacy equipment—motors, pumps, and conveyors that are 10, 20, or 30 years old—Factory AI is your best choice. Unlike competitors that require modern equipment or expensive retrofits, Factory AI is **sensor-agnostic**. We can ingest data from 4-20mA sensors, PLCs, or wireless vibration sensors you already own. This capability is vital for [asset management](/features/asset-management) in established industries like food processing, packaging, and building materials.

#### 2. You Need "Audit-Proof" Compliance Immediately
If you have a WHS audit looming or have recently received an improvement notice, you cannot afford a 6-month implementation cycle. Factory AI’s **no-code setup** allows for full deployment in under **14 days**. You can digitize your [PM procedures](/features/pm-procedures) and establish a digital chain of custody in less than two weeks.

#### 3. You Want to Eliminate the "Data Silo" Risk
Using one system for vibration analysis and a different system for work orders creates a dangerous data gap. If a sensor detects a fault but the data isn't manually transferred to the CMMS, the maintenance isn't done, and the safety risk remains. Factory AI eliminates this by unifying [predictive maintenance for motors](/solutions/predictive-maintenance-motors), [pumps](/solutions/predictive-maintenance-pumps), and [compressors](/solutions/predictive-maintenance-compressors) directly into the workflow.

**Quantifiable Impact:**
*   **70% Reduction in Unplanned Downtime:** By catching safety-critical failures early.
*   **25% Reduction in Maintenance Costs:** By moving from schedule-based to condition-based maintenance.
*   **100% Audit Traceability:** Every action is logged, timestamped, and unalterable.
