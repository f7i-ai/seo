In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (two men, one woman) are standing near a large industrial pump. They are wearing clean, professional PPE including white hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One technician is holding a ruggedized tablet, showing only the back of the device to the camera. In the background, the facility is brightly lit with high ceilings; subtle blue and green LED indicators are visible on various machines, suggesting an IIoT-connected environment. The floor is polished concrete with clear safety markings. The overall atmosphere is one of organized, high-tech efficiency. No text or logos are visible. Full-body shots of the professionals.",
