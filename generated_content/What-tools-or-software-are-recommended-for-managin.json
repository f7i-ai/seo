  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern, clean manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance professionals (men and women) are collaborating. One technician is wearing a hard hat and safety glasses, looking at a tablet that displays a 3D model of a motor with data overlays (green and red status indicators). Another engineer is pointing at a large industrial pump in the background. The background features automated machinery, conveyor belts, and soft, cool industrial lighting. No text or words should be visible in the image. The atmosphere should convey technology, safety, and efficiency.",
