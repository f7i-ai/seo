  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, photo-realistic image of a diverse team of three industrial professionals (two men, one woman) in a modern, clean manufacturing facility. They are wearing full PPE, including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility vests over professional work clothes. They are standing near a large, complex piece of industrial machinery with stainless steel components and blue accents. One person is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet, showing only the back of the device to the camera. They are engaged in a serious, collaborative discussion, pointing toward a specific section of the machinery. The lighting is bright and professional, highlighting the clean environment and the advanced technology of the plant. No text or logos are visible. Full-body or three-quarter view.",
