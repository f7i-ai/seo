  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, photo-realistic wide shot of a modern, clean industrial manufacturing floor in 2026. In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are standing near a large, complex robotic assembly arm. They are wearing professional navy blue work uniforms, white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One technician is pointing toward a specific joint on the robotic arm while the others look on, demonstrating a collaborative diagnostic moment. The technicians are shown full-body. One technician is holding a rugged industrial tablet, but only the back of the device is visible to the camera. The background shows a well-lit factory environment with other machinery and safety yellow floor markings, all in sharp focus. No text or logos are visible on the equipment or clothing.",
