In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance professionals (men and women of various ethnicities) are wearing standard PPE including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. They are gathered around a large industrial motor and pump assembly. One technician is pointing at a specific component on the machine, while another holds a tablet (back of device visible only) as if referencing data. In the background, blurred automated conveyor belts and robotic arms are in motion. The lighting is bright and industrial, with cool blue and white tones emphasizing technology and cleanliness. No text or words should be visible in the image. The atmosphere conveys collaboration, expertise, and advanced technology.",
