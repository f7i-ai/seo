  "image_prompt": "A wide-angle, photo-realistic shot of a modern, highly organized industrial MRO warehouse in 2026. In the foreground, a diverse team of three maintenance professionals (two men, one woman) are standing near a high-tech shelving unit. They are wearing full PPE: clean high-visibility vests, white hard hats, and safety glasses. One person is holding a ruggedized handheld tablet (only the back of the device is visible). The warehouse features high ceilings, bright LED lighting, and neatly labeled bins with QR codes. In the background, a technician is operating a reach truck in a distant aisle. The atmosphere is professional, clean, and efficient, conveying a sense of advanced inventory control. No text or screens are visible.",
