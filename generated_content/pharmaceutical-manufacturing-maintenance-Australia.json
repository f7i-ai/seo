  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, wide-angle shot of a modern pharmaceutical manufacturing facility in Australia. The scene features a diverse group of engineering and maintenance professionals (men and women) wearing pristine white lab coats, hair nets, safety glasses, and blue nitrile gloves. They are standing near a high-tech, stainless steel blister packaging line. One engineer is holding a tablet (showing only the back of the device) while gesturing toward a specific component of the machine. The lighting is bright, clinical, and cool-toned, emphasizing cleanliness and sterility. In the background, blurred digital dashboards monitor equipment health. No text or words are visible in the image. The atmosphere conveys precision, compliance, and advanced technology.",
