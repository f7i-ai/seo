  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a reliability technician wearing a hard hat, safety glasses, and high-visibility vest is looking at a ruggedized tablet held in their left hand (screen not visible to camera). They are standing next to a large industrial electric motor and pump assembly. In the background, slightly out of focus, another worker is inspecting a control panel. The lighting is industrial but warm, highlighting the texture of the machinery and the PPE. No text or holographic overlays. The atmosphere conveys professionalism and advanced technology integration in a heavy industry setting.",
