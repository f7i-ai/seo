  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, high-quality image for a blog post on equipment maintenance. The scene is a clean, modern manufacturing facility. A diverse team of three maintenance professionals—a Black woman with her hair in a net, a Hispanic man, and an older white man—are gathered around a large, complex industrial machine. They are all wearing appropriate PPE, including safety glasses and high-visibility vests over their work uniforms. The woman is holding a ruggedized tablet displaying graphs and data, pointing to a specific data point. The two men are looking intently at the tablet and the corresponding part of the machine, engaged in a collaborative discussion. The lighting is bright and professional, highlighting the technology and the clean environment. The focus is on collaboration and data-driven problem-solving. There is no text in the image.",
