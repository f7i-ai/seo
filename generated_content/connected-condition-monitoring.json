  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, professional image for a manufacturing blog post. A female maintenance manager of South Asian descent with a hard hat and safety glasses is collaborating with a younger male technician of Hispanic descent, also in a hard hat and high-vis vest. They are standing in a clean, well-lit factory and looking together at a ruggedized tablet the manager is holding. The tablet screen displays colorful graphs and data charts related to equipment health. In the background, slightly out of focus, is a large, modern industrial pump and motor assembly. The image should convey teamwork, data-driven decisions, and modern technology in a manufacturing setting. There should be no text on the image.",
