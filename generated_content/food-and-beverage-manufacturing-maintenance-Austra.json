  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern Australian food and beverage manufacturing plant. The scene features a diverse team of maintenance technicians and engineers (men and women) wearing high-visibility vests, safety glasses, and hair nets (food safety PPE). They are standing near a large stainless steel conveyor belt system and a bottling line. One technician is holding a tablet (back of device visible only) inspecting a motor, while another points to a digital dashboard on a nearby monitor (screen blurred/indistinct).
