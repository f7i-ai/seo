  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern, clean manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers (one female, one male) wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests are examining a large industrial pump system. The female engineer is holding a tablet (back of device visible only) and pointing at a specific component on the pump, while the male engineer looks on intently. In the background, blurred slightly, are automated conveyor belts and digital dashboards displaying data graphs (no readable text). The lighting is professional and cool-toned, emphasizing technology and precision. The scene conveys collaboration, analysis, and modern industrial maintenance.",
