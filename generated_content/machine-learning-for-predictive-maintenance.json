  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern, high-tech manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers (men and women) wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests are gathered around a large industrial motor. One engineer is pointing at the motor, while another holds a tablet (back of the device facing the camera) referencing data. In the background, blurred automated conveyor lines and robotic arms are in motion. The lighting is a mix of cool industrial LED and warm accent lighting from the machinery. No text or overlays. The atmosphere is professional, focused, and technologically advanced.",
