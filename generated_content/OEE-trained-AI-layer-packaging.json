  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern high-tech packaging facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance engineers and plant managers (wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests) are looking at a large tablet held by one of them (only the back of the tablet is visible). They are standing in front of a complex packaging conveyor line with stainless steel machinery, blurred motion of bottles moving on the line. Overlaying the machinery in a subtle, semi-transparent way are digital holographic nodes or wireframes indicating \"digital twin\" or sensor data points, symbolizing the \"AI layer\" invisible to the naked eye. The lighting is industrial but warm, with a focus on the people and the machinery. 8k resolution, highly detailed.",
