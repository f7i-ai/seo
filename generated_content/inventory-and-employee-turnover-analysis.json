  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern but active \"brownfield\" manufacturing plant. In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance technicians (men and women of various ages) are wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. They look confident and calm, consulting a tablet (back of device visible only) while standing next to a large industrial conveyor system. In the background, blurred slightly, is a well-organized, bright parts storeroom with clearly labeled bins, symbolizing organized inventory. The lighting is professional industrial lighting, with a cool blue and warm amber contrast. No text or words in the image. The atmosphere conveys efficiency, safety, and high morale.",
