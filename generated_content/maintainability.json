  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, photo-realistic hero image of a modern industrial manufacturing environment. In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are standing near a large, complex industrial pump and motor assembly. They are wearing clean, professional PPE: white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility orange vests over navy work shirts. One technician is pointing toward a specific part of the machinery while the others look on, engaged in a collaborative technical discussion. One technician has a ruggedized tablet held in their hand, but only the back of the device is visible to the camera. The background shows a clean, well-lit \"brownfield\" factory floor with pipes, overhead conveyors, and other machinery slightly out of focus. The lighting is bright and professional, emphasizing a culture of safety and advanced technology. No text or screens are visible. Full-body shots of the professionals.",
