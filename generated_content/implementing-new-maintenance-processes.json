In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance technicians (men and women) are gathered around a large industrial machine. They are wearing standard PPE including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One technician is holding a ruggedized tablet, showing the back of the device (no screen visible), pointing toward a component on the machine while discussing with a colleague who is holding a specialized tool. The lighting is professional and dynamic, highlighting the clean, high-tech nature of modern manufacturing (Industry 4.0). The background shows blurred conveyor belts and robotic arms, implying a busy but organized environment. No text or overlays.",
