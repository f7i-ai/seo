  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, photo-realistic hero image of a modern manufacturing floor. In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are standing near a large industrial pump assembly. They are wearing clean, professional PPE including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility yellow vests. One technician is holding a ruggedized tablet, showing only the black back of the device to the camera. They are pointing toward a sensor mounted on the pump, appearing to be in a collaborative discussion. The background shows a clean, well-lit factory environment with various pipes and machinery, slightly out of focus to emphasize the personnel. No text or logos are visible on the equipment or clothing. Full-body shots showing the team standing on a polished concrete floor with yellow safety markings.",
