  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, wide-angle shot inside a clean, modern manufacturing facility in 2025. In the foreground, a female maintenance manager of South Asian descent and a male technician of Caucasian descent are looking at a tablet together. The tablet screen shows a graph similar to a P-F curve with real-time vibration data. They are both wearing safety glasses and company-branded polo shirts. In the background, a large, complex piece of industrial machinery with several visible IIoT sensors (small boxes with blinking blue lights) is in sharp focus. The lighting is bright and professional. The overall mood is one of collaboration, high-tech problem-solving, and operational control. No text on the image.",
