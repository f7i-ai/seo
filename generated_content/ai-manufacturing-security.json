  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers and plant operators (wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests) are gathered around a large industrial pump system. One engineer is holding a ruggedized tablet (showing only the back of the device) while inspecting a sensor attached to the machine. The background shows a clean, high-tech factory floor with blurred automated machinery and soft blue and amber industrial lighting. The atmosphere is professional and focused, emphasizing the connection between human oversight and advanced technology. No text or holograms in the image.",
