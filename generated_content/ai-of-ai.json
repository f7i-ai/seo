In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers and maintenance technicians (men and women, various ethnicities) are wearing standard PPE including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. They are standing near a large conveyor system. One technician is holding a ruggedized tablet, showing the back of the device to the camera (screen hidden). They are looking at a piece of machinery with focus and confidence, not confusion. The lighting is industrial but warm, highlighting the blend of physical machinery and digital oversight. No text or holograms in the air. 8k resolution.",
