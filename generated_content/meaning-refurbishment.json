  "image_prompt": "A hyper-realistic, professional hero image set inside a modern industrial manufacturing facility. The scene features a diverse group of maintenance engineers and facility managers (men and women of various ethnicities) wearing standard PPE including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. They are gathered around a large, complex industrial motor that is currently being refurbished; parts of the casing are open, revealing clean, metallic inner workings. One engineer is pointing to a specific component, while another holds a tablet (showing only the back of the device) to reference data. In the background, blurred slightly, are automated conveyor belts and yellow robotic arms, signifying a blend of old and new technology. The lighting is bright and cool, emphasizing cleanliness and precision. No text or words should appear in the image.",
