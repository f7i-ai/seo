Downtime is the duration during which a machine, production line, or entire facility is non-operational and unable to perform its intended function. In an industrial context, it represents the gap between a system’s potential availability and its actual production time, encompassing both scheduled maintenance and unexpected equipment failures.

### The Industrial Context of Downtime
In modern manufacturing and facility management, downtime is the primary antagonist of productivity. It is not merely a "break" in production; it is a critical metric used to calculate Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE). For maintenance managers in 2026, downtime is categorized into two distinct streams: planned and unplanned. Planned downtime includes scheduled [asset management](/features/asset-management) activities, such as lubrication, inspections, and parts replacement, which are necessary to ensure long-term reliability. Unplanned downtime, conversely, is the result of sudden mechanical failure, operator error, or environmental factors that force an immediate halt to operations.

### The Financial Anatomy of a Minute
To truly define downtime, one must look at the "Financial Anatomy of a Minute." In high-output environments, the cost of a single minute of downtime is far higher than the cost of the repair itself. It includes lost throughput (the products that weren't made), labor costs for idle workers, the "restart cost" of bringing machines back to operating temperature, and potential penalties for late deliveries. By analyzing the Root Cause Analysis (RCA) of these stops, organizations can identify whether the downtime was caused by a catastrophic failure or a series of "micro-stops"—brief interruptions that, while lasting only seconds, can aggregate into hours of lost production over a week.

### Managing Downtime in 2026
The goal of a modern maintenance department is not to eliminate downtime entirely—as equipment always requires care—but to shift the ratio from unplanned to planned. Utilizing [CMMS software](/products/cmms-software) allows teams to track Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) and Mean Time to Repair (MTTR), providing the data necessary to transform reactive "firefighting" into a streamlined, proactive workflow. With the integration of [manufacturing AI software](/solutions/manufacturing-ai-software), facilities can now move toward zero-unplanned-downtime targets by identifying signature vibration or thermal patterns that precede a breakdown.
