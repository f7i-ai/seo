  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, professional photograph of a modern manufacturing floor. In the foreground, a diverse pair of maintenance professionals (one male, one female) are collaborating. They are wearing clean, professional PPE including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One professional is holding a rugged industrial tablet, but only the back of the device is visible to the camera. They are standing near a large, well-maintained industrial motor and pump assembly. The background shows a clean, organized factory environment with soft bokeh, emphasizing a sense of precision and high-tech quality assurance. The lighting is bright and natural, avoiding harsh industrial glares. No text or logos are visible on the equipment or clothing.",
