  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern, clean manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a reliability engineer (wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-visibility vest) is viewed from the back/side, holding a ruggedized tablet. The tablet screen is not visible, but the engineer is looking up at a large, complex industrial machine (perhaps a compressor or conveyor system) that has a digital \"digital twin\" overlay or holographic interface subtly implied near it (not cartoony, just a hint of high-tech augmented reality). In the background, another technician in blue coveralls and PPE is inspecting a different section of the line. The lighting is industrial but warm, highlighting the integration of human expertise and advanced technology. No text in the image. 8k resolution.",
