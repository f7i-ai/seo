  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-resolution hero image set inside a modern, clean Australian manufacturing facility. The scene features a diverse group of three professionals: a Facility Manager (female, mid-30s) holding a tablet (back of device visible only), a Maintenance Technician (male, 40s) wearing a high-vis vest and hard hat, and a specialized Contractor (male, 20s) inspecting a large industrial motor. They are engaged in a collaborative discussion. The background shows blurred industrial machinery, yellow safety walkways, and safety signage typical of Australian WHS standards. The lighting is bright and professional. No text or overlays in the image. The atmosphere conveys safety, compliance, and technological integration.",
