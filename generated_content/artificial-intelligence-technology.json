  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern, clean manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse team of two industrial maintenance technicians (one male, one female) wearing full PPE (hard hats, safety glasses, high-vis vests) are inspecting a large, complex industrial motor. The female technician is holding a ruggedized tablet, but the screen is not visible to the viewer; she is looking at the machine, consulting the device. The male technician is pointing at a specific component of the motor. In the background, soft-focus digital overlays (subtle glowing lines or data nodes, not text) imply connectivity and digital twin technology without looking like a cartoon. The lighting is professional industrial lighting, cool tones with warm highlights on the machinery. No text or words in the image.",
