  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, professional corporate photo of a diverse team of three maintenance professionals in a bright, modern, and immaculately clean food processing facility. A male maintenance manager of South Asian descent is holding a tablet displaying a clear predictive maintenance alert and a vibration waveform. He is discussing it with a female technician of Caucasian descent, who is pointing to a wireless sensor on a large stainless steel industrial mixer. A younger male technician of African descent is observing the tablet with interest. All three are wearing appropriate PPE: white hairnets, safety glasses, and clean, blue company uniforms. The background shows other stainless steel equipment under bright, clean lighting, with a slight depth of field to keep the focus on the team and their interaction with the technology. The image should be free of any text or logos.",
