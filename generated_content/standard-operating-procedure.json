  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-resolution hero image set inside a modern but realistic \"brownfield\" manufacturing plant. The lighting is professional and industrial, with a mix of natural light from high windows and cool LED factory lighting. In the foreground, a diverse group of two industrial maintenance professionals (one male, one female) are standing near a large industrial motor or pump. They are wearing full PPE including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. The female technician is holding a ruggedized tablet, showing the back of the device (no screen visible), appearing to consult a digital workflow. The male technician is pointing toward a sensor attached to the machinery. The background shows active production lines with blurred motion to imply activity. No text or words should be visible in the image. The atmosphere should convey efficiency, safety, and modern technology integration in an industrial setting.",
