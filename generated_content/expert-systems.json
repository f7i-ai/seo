  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, photo-realistic wide shot of a modern, clean industrial manufacturing floor. In the foreground, a diverse team of two maintenance professionals (one man, one woman) are standing near a large, complex centrifugal pump system. They are wearing full PPE, including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility neon vests. One professional is holding an industrial tablet, showing only the rugged black back of the device to the camera. They are pointing toward a specific component of the pump, engaged in a collaborative technical discussion. The background shows a well-lit facility with various pipes, stainless steel machinery, and a distant overhead conveyor system, all in sharp focus. No text or digital overlays are visible.",
