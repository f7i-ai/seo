  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, professional photograph of a modern industrial manufacturing floor. In the foreground, a diverse team of three professionals—a female maintenance manager in a white hard hat and high-visibility vest, and two male technicians in blue uniforms and safety glasses—are standing near a large, well-maintained industrial pump system. One technician is holding a rugged industrial tablet, showing only the back of the device to the camera. They are engaged in a collaborative discussion, looking at the machinery. The background shows a clean, organized \"brownfield\" factory environment with various pipes, motors, and overhead conveyors, all clearly labeled and well-lit. The atmosphere is one of focused, high-tech industrial professionalism. No text or logos are visible. Full-body shots of the people wearing appropriate PPE.",
