  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, wide-angle shot inside a clean, modern manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse team of two people, a female maintenance manager of South Asian descent and a male quality engineer of Caucasian descent, are collaboratively looking at a tablet. The tablet screen displays a clear line graph showing a \"First Pass Yield\" metric trending upwards. Both are wearing safety glasses and professional company polo shirts. In the background, a sophisticated, well-lit production line with robotic arms and a conveyor system is visible but slightly out of focus, suggesting a high-tech environment. The overall mood is bright, positive, and focused on data-driven improvement. No text on the image.",
