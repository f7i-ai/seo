  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, photo-realistic hero image of a modern industrial manufacturing floor. In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are collaborating. They are wearing full PPE, including white hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility orange vests. One technician is holding an industrial tablet, but only the back of the device is visible to the camera. They are standing next to a large, heavy-duty hydraulic scissor lift and a series of overhead conveyors. The background shows a clean, well-lit brownfield factory environment with a mix of older machinery and modern sensors. The focus is on the professional collaboration and the scale of the material handling equipment. No text or screens are visible. Full body shots of the workers.",
