In the foreground, a reliability engineer (wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, and high-vis vest) is inspecting a large, industrial reciprocating compressor. The engineer is holding a handheld ultrasonic diagnostic device (seen from the back/side, no screen details visible) and pointing a probe toward a valve cap. The compressor is large, painted industrial grey or blue, with complex piping and analog gauges visible. In the background, slightly out of focus, a plant manager is looking at a tablet. The lighting is dramatic but professional, highlighting the steel textures and the seriousness of the maintenance task. No text overlays. 2026 industrial aesthetic.",
