A diverse group of maintenance professionals—a woman in a hard hat and a man in a high-visibility vest—are standing in front of a complex conveyor system. They are looking at a ruggedized tablet showing a predictive maintenance dashboard with green and yellow health indicators. In the background, the plant is clean and well-lit, symbolizing a shift from reactive \"grease-monkey\" maintenance to proactive, data-driven reliability engineering. No text in the image.",
