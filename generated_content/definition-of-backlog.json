  "image_prompt": "A professional, photo-realistic wide shot of a modern industrial manufacturing floor. In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are standing near a large, well-maintained centrifugal pump and motor assembly. They are wearing appropriate PPE, including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One technician is pointing toward a sensor mounted on the motor, while another holds a ruggedized industrial tablet (viewed from the back, showing a durable casing, no screen visible). The lighting is bright and clean, highlighting the \"brownfield\" nature of the plant with a mix of older structural elements and modern, clean machinery. The atmosphere is collaborative and focused. Full-body shots of the people, no text or logos visible.",
