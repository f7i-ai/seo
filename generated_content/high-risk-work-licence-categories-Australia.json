  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-quality hero image inside a modern Australian manufacturing facility. The scene features a diverse group of maintenance technicians and operators. In the foreground, a female technician wearing a hard hat, safety glasses, and high-visibility vest is inspecting a large industrial motor. She is holding a tablet (back of device visible only) that implies she is checking data. In the background, a yellow forklift (LF class) is moving a pallet, and an overhead gantry crane is visible near the ceiling. The lighting is industrial but bright and clean. No text or words should be visible in the image. The atmosphere conveys safety, compliance, and advanced technology.",
