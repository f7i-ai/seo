  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, high-resolution hero image for a blog post. In a bright, clean, modern packaging facility, a diverse team of three maintenance professionals—a Hispanic man, a Black woman, and an Asian woman—are gathered around a large, wall-mounted touchscreen monitor next to a complex packaging machine. They are all wearing proper PPE, including safety glasses and hairnets. The man is pointing at a colorful vibration signature graph on the screen, discussing it with his colleagues. The Black woman holds a ruggedized tablet displaying similar data. The Asian woman is listening intently. In the background, a packaging line with conveyors is visible but softly out of focus. The overall mood is collaborative, high-tech, and professional. No text or logos should be visible on the screen or clothing.",
