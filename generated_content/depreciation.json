  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-quality image set in a modern manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a maintenance manager (wearing a hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-visibility vest) is holding a tablet, looking at a large industrial machine. The tablet screen is not visible to the viewer. In the background, slightly out of focus, a finance professional in business casual attire (also wearing safety glasses) is pointing at the machine, holding a clipboard or folder. The lighting is industrial but warm, highlighting the collaboration between operations and finance. The machine looks complex, perhaps a conveyor system or a large CNC unit. No text or overlays in the image.",
