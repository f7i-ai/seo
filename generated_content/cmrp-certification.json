  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, photo-realistic wide shot of a modern, clean industrial manufacturing floor. In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are standing together in a collaborative huddle. They are wearing clean, professional PPE: white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility orange vests over navy blue work shirts. One professional is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet, but only the back of the device is visible to the camera. They are looking toward a large, complex piece of machinery (a robotic assembly arm or a large industrial pump) in the mid-ground. The lighting is bright and natural, coming from high warehouse windows. The background shows a well-organized plant with clear floor markings and other machinery, slightly out of focus to emphasize the professionals. No text, logos, or screens are visible. Full-body shots of the professionals.",
