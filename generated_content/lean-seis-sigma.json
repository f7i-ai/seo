They are wearing full PPE, including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility orange vests over work uniforms. One person is pointing toward a large, complex piece of automated machinery in the background, while another holds a ruggedized industrial tablet (viewed from the back, showing a black protective case). The lighting is bright and natural, highlighting the stainless steel surfaces of the equipment. The team looks engaged and collaborative, embodying a culture of continuous improvement and technical expertise. No text or digital overlays. Full-body shot showing the clean floor and organized workspace.",
