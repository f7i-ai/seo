  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers (men and women, various ethnicities) wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests are walking through an aisle of industrial machinery. They are looking confidently toward the horizon of the plant. One engineer in the center is holding a ruggedized tablet, but the screen is facing away from the camera (we only see the back of the device). The background features blurred, high-tech automated assembly lines with subtle blue and amber indicator lights, symbolizing active monitoring. The lighting is professional and dramatic, highlighting the clean, efficient nature of a smart factory. No text or words in the image.",
