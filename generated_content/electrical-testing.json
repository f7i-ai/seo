  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, professional photo of a diverse team of maintenance professionals (one man, one woman) performing a strategic electrical inspection in a modern industrial facility. Both individuals are wearing full PPE, including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. The man is using a handheld thermal imaging camera to inspect a large, clean electrical distribution panel, while the woman stands nearby with a ruggedized industrial tablet, appearing to coordinate the data. The shot is a full-body or three-quarter view, showing the scale of the industrial environment. The handheld devices are shown from the back/side to avoid showing specific screen content. The lighting is bright and professional, emphasizing a clean, safe, and technologically advanced manufacturing setting. No text or logos are visible.",
