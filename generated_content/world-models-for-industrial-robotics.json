  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a futuristic, high-tech automotive manufacturing plant. In the foreground, a diverse group of three industrial engineers (one female, two male) wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests are standing near a large, orange articulated robotic arm. They are looking at a tablet held by the central figure (back of tablet visible only), discussing the operation. The robotic arm is in motion, handling a complex metal component. The background is filled with depth, showing other automated machinery, clean floors, and cool blue industrial lighting mixed with warm safety lights. The atmosphere is professional, advanced, and focused on precision. No text or overlays. 8k resolution.",
