In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance engineers (men and women) wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests are gathered around a large industrial motor. One engineer is holding a tablet (back of device visible only) pointing toward a sensor on the machine. The background shows a clean, busy factory floor with blurred automated machinery and yellow safety lines. The lighting is professional and industrial, highlighting the clean PPE and the technology integration. No text or words in the image. 8k resolution, highly detailed.",
