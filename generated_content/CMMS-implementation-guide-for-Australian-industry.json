  "image_prompt": "A hyper-realistic, wide-angle shot of a modern Australian manufacturing facility interior. The scene features a diverse group of maintenance technicians and engineers (men and women) wearing standard Australian PPE: high-visibility yellow and orange vests with reflective strips, hard hats, safety glasses, and steel-capped boots. One technician is inspecting a large industrial motor or conveyor belt, holding a ruggedized tablet (showing only the back of the device, no screen content visible). In the background, blurred industrial machinery and yellow safety walkways are visible. The lighting is bright and professional, emphasizing a clean, high-tech industrial environment. No text or words in the image. 8k resolution, cinematic lighting.",
