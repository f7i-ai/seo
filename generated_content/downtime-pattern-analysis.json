  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern, high-tech manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a reliability engineer (wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-visibility vest) is examining a large industrial motor or conveyor system. They are holding a tablet (back of the device visible) as if comparing data on the screen to the physical asset. In the background, blurred slightly, are other technicians working and automated machinery in motion. The lighting is industrial but dramatic, with cool blue and warm amber tones highlighting the metallic textures of the equipment. No text or overlays. The atmosphere conveys precision, technology, and forensic analysis.",
