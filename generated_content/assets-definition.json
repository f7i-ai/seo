In the foreground, a reliability engineer (wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-visibility vest) is inspecting a large industrial electric motor. They are holding a tablet (back of the device visible) as if scanning a QR code on the machine. In the background, out of focus, a diverse group of technicians is working on a conveyor line.
