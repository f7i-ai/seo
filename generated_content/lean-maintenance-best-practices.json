In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance professionals (a reliability engineer in a white hard hat, a technician in a blue hard hat, and a facility manager) are standing around a large industrial pump system. They are looking at a tablet held by the engineer (screen not visible to camera) and pointing at a specific component of the machine, engaging in collaborative problem solving. The background is slightly blurred but shows high-tech automated machinery and yellow safety walkways. The lighting is bright and industrial, with a cool blue hue emphasizing technology and cleanliness. All subjects are wearing appropriate PPE including safety glasses and high-visibility vests.
