In the foreground, a reliability engineer (wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-visibility vest) is looking at a tablet held in their left hand (screen not visible to the viewer). They are gesturing with their right hand toward a large industrial electric motor connected to a pump system. The motor has a small, wireless orange sensor attached to the casing. In the background, out of focus, another technician in blue coveralls is inspecting a conveyor belt. The lighting is industrial but bright, highlighting the clean, high-tech nature of the facility. No text or overlays in the image. 16:9 aspect ratio.",
