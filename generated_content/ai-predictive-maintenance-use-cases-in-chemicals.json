  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, high-resolution image of a modern chemical plant control room. In the foreground, a diverse team of three people—a male maintenance manager of South Asian descent, a female operator of Caucasian descent, and a younger male engineer of Black descent—are looking at a large, vibrant screen. All are wearing safety glasses and company-branded flame-retardant clothing. The screen displays a sophisticated AI predictive maintenance dashboard with graphs showing vibration trends, a 3D digital twin of a pump and motor assembly with a color-coded health status, and a list of prescriptive work orders. Through a large window behind them, the clean and complex piping of a chemical processing unit is visible under a clear sky. The lighting is bright and professional, emphasizing a sense of calm control and advanced technology. The image should be text-free.",
