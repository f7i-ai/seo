Two maintenance professionals, a man and a woman of diverse backgrounds, are inspecting a large, blue industrial induction motor. They are wearing full professional PPE: white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility orange vests over navy blue work uniforms. One professional is using a handheld thermal imaging camera (showing only the back of the device) to scan the motor's housing, while the other is looking at a tablet (showing only the back). The environment is clean, well-lit, and features polished concrete floors and organized conduit piping in the background. No text or logos are visible. Full body shots of the professionals.",
