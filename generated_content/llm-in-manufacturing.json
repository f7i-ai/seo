  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, high-resolution image for a corporate blog post. The setting is a modern, clean, and well-lit manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a female maintenance manager of South Asian descent with her hair tied back, wearing a hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-visibility vest, is collaborating with a younger male technician of Hispanic descent, also in full PPE. They are both looking at a ruggedized tablet the manager is holding. The tablet screen emits a soft glow, but the content is not visible. In the background, slightly out of focus, is a complex piece of industrial machinery, like a multi-axis robotic arm or a sophisticated conveyor system, suggesting a high-tech environment. The overall mood is professional, collaborative, and forward-thinking. No text on the image.",
