Provisioning is the systematic process of configuring, deploying, and managing IT and OT (Operational Technology) resources to make them available to users, systems, or devices within an organization. In a modern industrial environment, it represents the critical transition from a dormant asset to a functional, networked component capable of contributing to production goals.

### The Role of Provisioning in Operational Readiness
In the context of 2026 industrial operations, provisioning is no longer viewed as a back-office IT task; it is a fundamental prerequisite for **Operational Readiness**. When a facility acquires new hardware—such as an IIoT-enabled pump or a technician’s mobile diagnostic tool—provisioning is the workflow that grants that device the necessary permissions, installs required software, and connects it to the local network. 

Effective provisioning ensures that every asset is "born" into the system with the correct security protocols and data tags. This is particularly vital for **User Lifecycle Management**, where Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) ensures that a maintenance lead has different system permissions than a third-party contractor. By automating these workflows, plants reduce the "time-to-value" for new equipment and minimize human error during the setup phase.

### Types of Industrial Provisioning
1.  **Device Provisioning (IIoT Onboarding):** The process of connecting sensors and edge devices to the industrial network, ensuring they can transmit data to a centralized [CMMS software](/products/cmms-software) or predictive platform.
2.  **User Provisioning:** Managing the identity and access rights of personnel. This often involves **Active Directory Integration** to ensure that when a staff member is promoted or leaves, their access to sensitive maintenance data is updated instantly.
3.  **Resource Allocation:** The digital assignment of server space, cloud computing power, or bandwidth required to run high-intensity applications like [AI-driven predictive maintenance](/features/ai-predictive-maintenance).

### Provisioning vs. Configuration
While often used interchangeably, provisioning and configuration are distinct. Provisioning is the act of "providing" the resource and setting up its foundational environment. Configuration is the subsequent step of fine-tuning that resource to meet specific operational parameters. For example, provisioning grants a vibration sensor access to the Wi-Fi network; configuration tells that sensor to alert the team only when a specific frequency threshold is exceeded.

According to the [National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)](https://www.nist.gov), robust provisioning is also a cornerstone of cybersecurity, as it prevents "shadow IT" and ensures all active devices are accounted for and patched.
