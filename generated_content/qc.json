  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-resolution image set in a modern, clean manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse maintenance technician wearing a hard hat, safety glasses, and high-visibility vest is inspecting a complex industrial machine (like a conveyor or automated assembly line). The technician is holding a tablet, but only the back of the tablet is visible. In the background, slightly out of focus, a digital dashboard screen displays graphs and green status indicators, symbolizing data-driven quality control. The lighting is professional and bright, highlighting the cleanliness and high-tech nature of the facility. No text or words should be visible in the image.",
