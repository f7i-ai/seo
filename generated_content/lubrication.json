  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern, clean manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse team of reliability engineers (men and women) wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests are inspecting a large industrial motor. One engineer is holding a generic handheld ultrasound device (back of device visible only) against a bearing housing, while another points to a large industrial machine in the background. The lighting is dramatic but professional, highlighting the metallic textures of the machinery. No text or screens are visible. The atmosphere conveys precision, technology, and industrial safety.",
