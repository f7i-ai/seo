In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers and a plant manager (wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-vis vests) are gathered around a large industrial motor. One engineer is pointing at the motor, while another holds a tablet (back of tablet visible only) as if referencing data. In the background, blurred automated machinery and conveyors are in motion. The lighting is a mix of cool industrial LED and warm highlights, emphasizing a clean, futuristic, and efficient environment. No text or overlays.",
