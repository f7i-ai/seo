  "image_prompt": "A realistic, high-resolution photo inside a modern manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance technicians (wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and reflective vests) are gathered around a large industrial motor. One technician is holding a ruggedized tablet, showing the back of the device (no screen visible). They are looking at the machinery, not the camera. In the background, blurred slightly, are automated conveyor belts and robotic arms. The lighting is industrial but warm, highlighting the clean, high-tech nature of modern manufacturing. No text overlays or floating holograms. Professional, documentary style.",
