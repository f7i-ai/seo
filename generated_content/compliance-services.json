  "image_prompt": "A wide-angle, photo-realistic shot of a modern, clean industrial manufacturing floor. In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (one female, two male) are standing near a large, well-maintained industrial motor. They are wearing full PPE: white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility yellow vests. One technician is holding a tablet, but only the back of the device is visible to the camera. The background shows a series of conveyors and stainless steel piping, all brightly lit with natural and overhead LED lighting. The atmosphere is professional, organized, and safe. No text or logos are visible on the equipment or clothing. Full-body shots of the people, showing them engaged in a technical discussion.",
