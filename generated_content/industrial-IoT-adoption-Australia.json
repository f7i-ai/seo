  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern Australian manufacturing facility. The scene features a diverse group of maintenance engineers and operations managers (men and women) wearing standard Australian safety gear: high-visibility yellow and orange vests with reflective strips, hard hats, and safety glasses. They are standing near a large industrial conveyor belt system and a series of heavy industrial pumps. One engineer is inspecting a small, wireless sensor attached to a motor, while another holds a tablet (back of the device visible only) gesturing toward the machinery. The lighting is professional and industrial, highlighting the \"brownfield\" nature of the equipment—clean but clearly used, not futuristic sci-fi. No text or holograms in the image. The atmosphere conveys efficiency, safety, and modern technology integration.",
