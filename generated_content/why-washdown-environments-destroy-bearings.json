Visible mist and water droplets are refracting the bright overhead LED lights. The background shows a clean, stainless steel conveyor line. A maintenance technician in a white lab coat and blue nitrile gloves is visible in the blurred background, holding a thermal imaging camera. Photo-realistic, 8k resolution, cinematic lighting.",
