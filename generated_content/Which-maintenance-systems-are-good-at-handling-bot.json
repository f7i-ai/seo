  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, wide-angle shot of a modern manufacturing facility interior. The composition is split visually to show the convergence of two worlds: on the left, heavy utility infrastructure like large insulated pipes, a silver industrial boiler, and pressure gauges; on the right, a high-tech production line with a conveyor belt and a robotic arm. In the center foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (one female, two male) are standing together. They are wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. The person in the middle is holding a tablet, showing the back of the device to the camera (screen hidden). They are looking up at the machinery, engaged in a collaborative discussion. The lighting is bright, industrial, and clean, emphasizing a high-tech, efficient environment. No text or words in the image.",
