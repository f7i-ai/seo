A good inventory turnover ratio for Maintenance, Repair, and Operations (MRO) typically falls between **2.0 and 4.0 annually**, though this varies significantly based on industry criticality and supply chain stability. This metric measures how many times a facility's inventory is used and replaced over a specific period, calculated by dividing the cost of goods sold (or parts issued) by the average inventory value.

### The MRO Paradox: Efficiency vs. Resilience
In a traditional retail environment, a high inventory turnover ratio is almost always desirable because it indicates rapid sales and minimal wasted capital. However, in the 2026 industrial landscape, maintenance managers must navigate the "MRO Paradox." A turnover ratio that is "too high" (e.g., above 6.0 or 8.0) often signals a dangerously lean inventory strategy. While this looks excellent on a financial balance sheet, it frequently results in a high **stockout rate**, where the absence of a single critical spare can lead to catastrophic downtime costs that far outweigh any savings in **carrying cost of inventory**.

Conversely, a ratio below 1.0 suggests that the facility is holding "dead stock" or **obsolete inventory**. This ties up working capital and occupies valuable warehouse space. The goal of a modern maintenance department is not to maximize turnover, but to optimize it for **operational resilience**. This involves a tiered approach where fast-moving consumables (like filters or lubricants) have high turnover, while **critical spares** (like custom gearboxes or specialized sensors) may have a turnover ratio near zero but remain essential for risk mitigation.

### Benchmarking with ABC Analysis
To determine if your ratio is "good," industrial leaders utilize **ABC Analysis (Always Better Control)**. This categorizes inventory into three groups:
*   **A-Items:** High-value parts with low frequency of use (Lower turnover).
*   **B-Items:** Moderate value and frequency.
*   **C-Items:** Low-value, high-volume consumables (Higher turnover).

By segmenting the inventory, managers can apply different **Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)** models to each group. A "good" overall ratio is the weighted average of these categories that maintains a high service level while minimizing waste. According to the [National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)](https://www.nist.gov), integrating supply chain data with maintenance schedules is vital for maintaining these balances in volatile markets.

### The Role of Lead Time and Criticality
In 2026, **lead time variability** has become a primary driver of what constitutes a healthy ratio. If a critical component has a six-month lead time, holding more safety stock—and thus lowering your turnover ratio—is a strategic decision for resilience. Effective **work order management** ensures that parts are issued precisely when needed, preventing artificial spikes in turnover data and providing a clearer picture of actual inventory health.
