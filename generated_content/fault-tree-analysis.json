  "image_prompt": "A professional, photo-realistic scene in a modern industrial control room. A diverse group of three maintenance managers and engineers—two men and one woman of different ethnicities—are gathered around a large, sleek industrial workstation. They are wearing clean, professional work uniforms with high-visibility vests, hard hats, and safety glasses. One engineer is pointing toward a large, wall-mounted digital display that shows a complex, glowing logic tree diagram (no legible text). Another engineer is holding a rugged industrial tablet, showing only the back of the device. The environment is brightly lit with a mix of natural light and cool industrial LEDs, showing glimpses of a clean, high-tech manufacturing floor through a large glass window in the background. The focus is on their collaborative problem-solving and the professional atmosphere of a high-stakes reliability center.",
