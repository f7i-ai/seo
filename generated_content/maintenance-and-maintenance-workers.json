  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern but active \"brownfield\" manufacturing plant. In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance workers (men and women of different ages and ethnicities) are collaborating. They are wearing professional PPE including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One worker is holding a ruggedized tablet, showing the back of the device (no screen visible) to a colleague who is pointing at a large industrial motor. The background features authentic industrial machinery—conveyors, pipes, and yellow safety railings—slightly blurred to emphasize the people. The lighting is a mix of natural light from high windows and cool industrial LED lighting, creating a professional, clean, and high-tech atmosphere. No text or words in the image.",
