  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, professional wide shot of a modern industrial manufacturing floor. In the foreground, a diverse team of three maintenance professionals (one man, two women) are standing together near a large, well-maintained industrial pump and motor assembly. They are wearing clean, professional PPE including white hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One person is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet, showing only the back of the device to the camera. They are engaged in a collaborative discussion, pointing toward a sensor mounted on the motor. The background shows a clean, organized \"brownfield\" factory environment with a mix of older machinery and modern digital integration points. The lighting is bright and natural, emphasizing a high-tech yet practical atmosphere. No text or words are visible in the image. Full-body or three-quarter shots of the people.",
