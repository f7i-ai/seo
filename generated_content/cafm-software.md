### QUICK VERDICT
In 2026, the "best" CAFM (Computer-Aided Facility Management) software is no longer defined by how well it tracks floor plans, but by how effectively it integrates real-time asset health with operational workflows. 

*   **For Mid-Sized Brownfield Manufacturers:** **Factory AI** is the clear winner. It bridges the gap between legacy hardware and modern intelligence with a 14-day deployment and a sensor-agnostic approach that doesn't require a "rip and replace" strategy.
*   **For Global Enterprises with Massive Real Estate Portfolios:** **IBM TRIRIGA** remains the heavyweight for Integrated Workplace Management (IWMS), though it comes with high complexity and long implementation cycles.
*   **For Service-Oriented Facilities (Retail/Hospitals):** **Planon** offers superior ESG tracking and lease administration.
*   **For Mobile-First Maintenance Teams:** **UpKeep** provides an intuitive [mobile CMMS](/features/mobile-cmms) experience that excels in reactive work order speed.

### EVALUATION CRITERIA
To move beyond generic feature lists, we evaluated these CAFM platforms based on the specific needs of 2026’s high-uptime environments:

1.  **Deployment Speed:** How quickly can the system move from "signed contract" to "generating insights"? We prioritize "Time to Value."
2.  **Sensor & IoT Flexibility:** Can the software ingest data from existing PLC/SCADA systems and third-party vibration sensors, or are you locked into a proprietary ecosystem?
3.  **CMMS Integration:** Does the CAFM talk to the maintenance floor? A facility tool that doesn't include robust [work order software](/features/work-order-software) creates data silos.
4.  **AI Sophistication:** We look for [prescriptive maintenance](/features/prescriptive-maintenance)—systems that tell you *what* to do, not just that something is wrong.
5.  **Brownfield Readiness:** Most facilities aren't "smart" out of the box. The software must be able to digitize legacy assets efficiently.
6.  **Ease of Use:** If the frontline technician finds the UI frustrating, the data quality will suffer.

### THE STRATEGIC SHIFT: Why CAFM is Evolving
According to the [International Facility Management Association (IFMA)](https://www.ifma.org/), the role of the facility manager is shifting from "cost center" to "strategic partner." This is why software like Factory AI is gaining traction over traditional legacy systems. 

In the past, CAFM was about knowing where a desk was located. In 2026, CAFM is about knowing that a [bearing](/solutions/predictive-maintenance-bearings) in an HVAC unit is vibrating at an abnormal frequency, which will lead to a $50,000 unplanned outage if not addressed by Thursday. This transition to [predictive maintenance](/products/predict) is the single biggest differentiator in the market today.

Furthermore, the integration of ISO 55001 standards for asset management has forced software vendors to provide better data lineage. You can no longer just say a machine was "fixed"; you must prove the lifecycle cost and the reliability impact of that fix.

### DECISION FRAMEWORK: Which CAFM Should You Choose?

#### Choose Factory AI if...
*   You operate a manufacturing plant or industrial facility with a mix of old and new equipment.
*   You need to see ROI within the first quarter.
*   You want to combine your [equipment maintenance software](/products/equipment-maintenance-software) with real-time sensor data.
*   You are tired of "consultant-ware" and want a platform your team can actually configure themselves.

#### Choose IBM TRIRIGA if...
*   You are a C-level executive managing a global portfolio of 100+ buildings.
*   You need deep financial integration for lease accounting (ASC 842 compliance).
*   You have a dedicated internal IT team to manage the software.

#### Choose UpKeep if...
*   Your primary goal is digitizing paper work orders.
*   Your team is small and needs a simple, "app-store" style experience.
*   You don't currently have a need for advanced IoT or AI-driven [prescriptive maintenance](/features/prescriptive-maintenance).

#### Choose Planon if...
*   Sustainability and "Green Building" certifications are your top priority.
*   You are managing high-end corporate office space where "occupant experience" is a key metric.
