  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern, clean manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse pair of workers: an older, experienced mentor (male, 50s, wearing safety glasses and a hard hat) and a younger apprentice (female, 20s, wearing full PPE including high-vis vest). They are standing next to a complex industrial conveyor system. The apprentice is holding a ruggedized tablet (back of tablet visible) and appears to be scanning a component on the machine, while the mentor points at a specific mechanical part, explaining a concept. The background is slightly blurred but shows depth of the factory floor with automated machinery and yellow safety walkways. Lighting is professional and industrial, highlighting the collaboration and technology integration. No text in the image.",
