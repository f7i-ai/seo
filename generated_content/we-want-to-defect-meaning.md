In a B2B industrial context, the phrase **"we want to defect"** refers to a customer's formal or strategic intent to terminate an ongoing relationship with a vendor, service provider, or software platform in favor of a competitor or an alternative internal solution. Unlike consumer churn, which is often passive, industrial defection is a calculated business move typically driven by a need to resolve technical debt, reduce operational costs, or upgrade to more advanced technological capabilities.

### The Context of Defection in 2026
For maintenance managers and facility operators, the decision to defect usually centers on the software stack—specifically Computerized Maintenance Management Systems (CMMS) or Enterprise Asset Management (EAM) platforms. By 2026, the cost of remaining with a legacy provider that lacks interoperability or advanced analytics often outweighs the "switching costs" associated with moving to a new provider. 

When an organization signals that they "want to defect," they are initiating a complex process that involves auditing [Service Level Agreements (SLAs)](https://www.nist.gov), evaluating data portability, and mitigating the risks of operational downtime during the transition. This intent is rarely about a single failure; rather, it is the culmination of "SaaS attrition," where the current vendor fails to keep pace with the facility's evolving needs for predictive insights and mobile accessibility.

### Key Drivers of Industrial Defection
1. **Technical Debt:** Legacy systems that require excessive manual workarounds or lack modern API connectivity become a liability.
2. **Data Portability Issues:** If a vendor makes it difficult to extract historical maintenance data, the desire to defect increases as the organization seeks better data sovereignty.
3. **Operational Redundancy:** As facilities move toward autonomous maintenance, older platforms that cannot support real-time sensor integration lead to redundant processes.
4. **Contractual Breach or Poor Support:** Consistent failure to meet uptime guarantees or provide adequate technical support is the most common catalyst for a "clean break" strategy.

### Managing the Transition
A successful defection requires a "Clean Break" guide. This involves mapping out the migration of asset hierarchies, preventive maintenance schedules, and spare parts inventories. Decision-makers must ensure that the new provider offers robust tools to minimize the friction of the move, ensuring that the transition does not result in missed work orders or equipment failure.

### Related Terms
### Customer Churn
While often used interchangeably with defection, churn is the metric used to measure the rate of loss, whereas defection is the specific act or intent of a client leaving.

### Vendor Switching Costs
These are the total costs—monetary, time-based, and psychological—incurred by a maintenance department when moving from one software ecosystem to another.
