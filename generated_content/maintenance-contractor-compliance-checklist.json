In the foreground, a facility manager (wearing a white hard hat and safety vest) and a contractor (wearing a blue hard hat, safety glasses, and a tool belt) are standing next to a large industrial pump system. The facility manager is holding a ruggedized tablet, showing the back of the device, while the contractor points to a lockout tag on the machine, verifying a safety step. The background is slightly blurred but shows high-tech machinery and yellow safety walkways. The lighting is industrial but warm, highlighting the professional collaboration and safety focus.
