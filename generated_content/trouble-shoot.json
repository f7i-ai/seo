  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, photo-realistic wide shot of a modern industrial manufacturing floor. In the foreground, a diverse team of three maintenance professionals (two men, one woman) are collaborating near a large, complex centrifugal pump system. They are wearing clean, professional PPE: white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility orange vests over navy work uniforms. One technician is pointing toward a specific section of the pump's housing, while another holds a ruggedized industrial tablet (shown from the back, no screen visible). The third technician is looking at a connection point on a nearby electrical panel. The background shows a clean, well-lit \"brownfield\" factory environment with a mix of older heavy machinery and modern stainless steel piping. The lighting is bright and professional, emphasizing a high-tech, efficient atmosphere. No text or logos are visible on the equipment or clothing. Full-body view of the professionals.",
