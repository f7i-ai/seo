  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-quality hero image inside a modern Australian manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a maintenance manager wearing a white hard hat, high-visibility vest, and safety glasses is looking up at a large yellow overhead gantry crane. The manager is holding a tablet (back of tablet visible only) as if checking a digital checklist. In the background, out of focus, other workers in PPE are operating machinery. The lighting is industrial but bright, highlighting the yellow crane against the steel structure of the roof. No text or overlays in the image. The atmosphere conveys safety, precision, and modern technology.",
