  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot of an open-cut mine in Queensland, Australia, during the \"golden hour\" of sunrise. The landscape features characteristic red dirt and massive mining infrastructure. In the foreground, a diverse group of mining maintenance professionals (men and women) are conducting an inspection. They are wearing full PPE: high-visibility orange and yellow shirts with reflective strips, white hard hats, safety glasses, and steel-capped boots. One engineer is holding a ruggedized tablet, viewing a complex data dashboard (screen not visible to camera, only the back of the device). In the background, a massive dragline and several large yellow haul trucks are in operation. The image conveys technology integration, safety, and industrial scale. No text or overlays.",
