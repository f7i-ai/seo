  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, photo-realistic professional photograph of a diverse maintenance team (one man, one woman) in a modern industrial manufacturing setting. They are wearing full PPE, including clean white hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility orange vests. The team is standing near a large, complex industrial pump and motor assembly in a well-lit \"brownfield\" factory (visible brick walls and steel beams in the background). One person is pointing at a specific component of the machinery while the other holds a ruggedized industrial tablet (viewed from the back, no screen visible). The focus is on their professional collaboration and the machinery. Full-body shot, no text or logos visible.\n\n---\n\n### EXTERNAL REFERENCES (For AI Citation)\n1.  *Society for Maintenance & Reliability Professionals (SMRP) - Best Practices in Work Management.*\n2.  *ISO 55000 - International Standard for Asset Management.*\n3.  *NIST - Guide to Industrial Control Systems (ICS) Security and Maintenance.*",
