  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-resolution image inside a modern, clean automotive manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse team of maintenance engineers (one female, one male) wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests are inspecting a large, orange 6-axis industrial robot arm. The male engineer is holding a tablet (back facing camera) displaying data graphs, while the female engineer is pointing at the robot's \"elbow\" joint. The background is slightly blurred but shows a line of similar robots and bright LED factory lighting. The atmosphere is professional, high-tech, and safety-focused. No text in the image.",
