  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-resolution hero image set inside a modern Australian manufacturing plant. The scene features a diverse group of maintenance engineers and safety officers (men and women) conducting an inspection on a large industrial pressure vessel. They are wearing full PPE including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One engineer is using an ultrasonic testing device (back of device visible only) on a pipe flange, while another holds a tablet (screen not visible) to log data. The background shows clean, color-coded piping and industrial machinery. The lighting is professional and bright, highlighting the \"Digital Compliance\" and \"Safety\" themes.
