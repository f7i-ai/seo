  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-quality hero image set inside a modern Australian manufacturing facility. The scene focuses on a diverse group of maintenance technicians (men and women) wearing full Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One technician is in the foreground, viewed from behind or the side, holding a generic industrial tablet (screen not visible) and looking at a large electrical switchboard that has a red Lockout/Tagout (LOTO) padlock clearly visible on a switch. In the background, blurred slightly, are conveyor belts and industrial machinery. The lighting is professional and bright, emphasizing safety and technology. No text or words should be visible in the image.",
