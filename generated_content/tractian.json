  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, professional photograph of a diverse team of three industrial maintenance professionals in a modern, clean manufacturing facility. One woman in a white hard hat and high-visibility vest is standing near a large industrial pump system, looking towards two colleagues. A man in a blue hard hat and safety glasses is standing next to her, holding a ruggedized industrial tablet (showing only the back of the device). A third person is visible in the background inspecting a different section of the machinery. All individuals are wearing full PPE, including safety boots and ear protection. The lighting is bright and industrial, highlighting the metallic textures of the pipes and motors. The focus is sharp on the foreground team, with a slight professional bokeh in the background.
