  "image_prompt": "A hyper-realistic, wide-angle shot of a modern maquiladora interior in Mexico. The facility is clean, bright, and high-tech. In the foreground, a diverse group of engineers and technicians (Latino and Caucasian mix) are collaborating. They are wearing standard PPE: hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One technician is holding a tablet, but only the back of the device is visible. In the background, automated robotic arms and conveyor belts are in operation. The lighting is industrial cool white with hints of safety yellow. No text or words should be visible in the image. The atmosphere conveys efficiency, technology, and cross-border collaboration.",
