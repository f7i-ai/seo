In the foreground, a diverse team of three maintenance professionals (one female, two male) are standing near a large industrial motor and pump assembly. They are wearing clean, professional PPE including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility orange vests over work shirts. One technician is pointing toward a specific component of the machinery while another holds a ruggedized industrial tablet (viewed from the back, showing a sturdy black case). The environment is well-lit, clean, and organized, representing a high-tech \"Factory of the Future.\" The background shows blurred rows of similar machinery and overhead conveyors, conveying a sense of scale and productivity.
