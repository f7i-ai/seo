  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a reliability engineer wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-visibility vest is inspecting a large industrial electric motor. The engineer is viewed from the side/back, holding a tablet (screen not visible) in one hand and placing a wireless vibration sensor on the motor housing with the other. The background is slightly blurred, showing depth with other machinery, yellow safety walkways, and perhaps another worker in the distance. The lighting is industrial but warm, highlighting the texture of the machinery and the professionalism of the environment. No text or overlays.",
