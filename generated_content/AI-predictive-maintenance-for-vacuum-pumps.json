  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern industrial manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a reliability engineer (wearing a hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-visibility vest) is inspecting a large, industrial blue vacuum pump system. The engineer is holding a tablet (screen not visible) and looking at a wireless sensor mounted on the pump housing. The background is slightly blurred, showing clean piping, pressure gauges, and other industrial machinery. The lighting is dramatic but professional, highlighting the texture of the metal and the technology. No text or words in the image. 8k resolution.",
