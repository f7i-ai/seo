They are wearing full PPE including hard hats, high-visibility vests, and safety glasses. One technician is holding a rugged tablet (showing only the back of the device, no screen content visible) and appears to be discussing a digital workflow with the manager. In the background, there is industrial machinery like conveyors and motors, clean and well-lit. The atmosphere is professional, focused on safety and technology. No text or words in the image. Cinematic lighting. 8k resolution.",
