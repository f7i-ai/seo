  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern, clean manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance technicians (wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests) are gathered around a large industrial motor. One technician is holding a rugged tablet (back facing camera) pointing it at the machinery, implying the use of augmented reality or digital diagnostics.
