Waste is defined as any activity, resource, or process that consumes time, capital, or effort without adding value to the final product or improving operational uptime. In the context of industrial maintenance and operations, waste refers to non-value-added (NVA) activities that drain a facility's budget and reduce equipment availability without contributing to the reliability or longevity of the asset.

### The Maintenance Perspective on Waste
For maintenance managers in 2026, defining waste goes beyond simple scrap material. It is viewed through the lens of Lean methodology, specifically the concepts of **Muda** (wastefulness), **Mura** (unevenness), and **Muri** (overburden). While a dictionary might define waste as "discarded material," a maintenance professional defines it as any barrier to achieving high Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE).

To effectively eliminate waste, industrial leaders categorize it into the "Maintenance 8," an adaptation of the traditional eight wastes of Lean manufacturing:

1.  **Defects:** Rework caused by poor initial repairs or substandard spare parts, leading to premature failure.
2.  **Over-Maintenance:** Performing calendar-based preventive maintenance on assets that do not require it, often introducing "infant mortality" failures through unnecessary intervention.
3.  **Waiting:** Technicians standing idle while waiting for work orders, spare parts, equipment shutdowns, or safety permits.
4.  **Non-Utilized Talent:** Failing to leverage the specialized diagnostic skills of senior technicians by assigning them to menial, repetitive tasks.
5.  **Transportation:** Unnecessary movement of heavy tools, machinery, or parts across a facility due to poor workshop layout.
6.  **Inventory:** Excess MRO (Maintenance, Repair, and Operations) stock that ties up working capital and risks obsolescence.
7.  **Motion:** Low "Wrench Time" caused by technicians spending excessive time walking to tool cribs or searching for documentation.
8.  **Extra-Processing:** Redundant data entry or over-reporting that does not contribute to better decision-making or asset reliability.

### Why Defining Waste Matters
Identifying waste is the first step toward optimizing the Planned Maintenance Percentage (PMP) and reducing the total cost of ownership for critical assets. When waste is clearly defined and measured, organizations can pivot from reactive "firefighting" to proactive, data-driven strategies. By eliminating NVA activities, facilities can improve their "Wrench Time"—the actual time a technician spends performing physical maintenance—which typically averages only 25-35% in unoptimized environments.

In the modern smart factory, waste is also identified through data silos and "dark data." If a sensor collects vibration data but that data is never analyzed to prevent a failure, the energy and capital spent on that sensor constitute operational waste.
