  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern, clean manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of three professionals are standing: a maintenance manager in a white hard hat and high-vis vest holding a tablet (back of tablet visible), pointing toward a large, complex automated production line. Next to them is a female executive in business professional attire (blazer) wearing safety glasses, looking engaged and nodding. A third person, a technician in blue coveralls, is inspecting a motor in the background. The lighting is bright and industrial, with depth of field blurring the distant machinery. No text or overlays. The atmosphere conveys collaboration and data-driven decision-making.",
