  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-resolution hero image inside a modern manufacturing facility. The scene features a diverse group of maintenance professionals (men and women of various ethnicities) wearing standard industrial PPE including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. They are standing near a large industrial conveyor system. One technician is holding a tablet device, but only the back of the device is visible (no screen content). They appear to be in a discussion, looking at a specific component of the machinery. The lighting is professional and industrial, highlighting the clean, organized nature of the facility. No text or overlays in the image. The atmosphere conveys competence, technology, and collaboration.",
