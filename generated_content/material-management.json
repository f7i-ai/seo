In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (one man, two women) are collaborating. They are wearing clean, high-visibility vests, white hard hats, and safety glasses. One person is pointing toward a neatly organized rack of MRO spare parts (motors, gears, and sealed components), while another holds a ruggedized tablet (back of the device visible to the camera). The background shows a clean, well-lit manufacturing floor with a mix of legacy and modern machinery. The lighting is bright and industrial, emphasizing a high-tech yet practical \"brownfield\" environment. No text or logos are visible on any surfaces. Full-body view of the workers.",
