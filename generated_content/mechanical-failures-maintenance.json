  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern, clean manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance professionals (a mix of genders and ethnicities) are gathered around a large industrial motor. They are wearing full PPE including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One technician is holding a thermal imaging camera (back of device visible), pointing it at the machinery, while another holds a tablet (screen hidden) reviewing data. The lighting is dramatic but professional, highlighting the metallic textures of the machinery and the focus of the team. The background shows blurred automated conveyor lines and robotic arms, implying a high-tech 2026 environment. No text or overlays.",
