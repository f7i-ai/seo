  "image_prompt": "A professional, photo-realistic wide shot of a modern but established (brownfield) food and beverage manufacturing plant. In the foreground, a diverse team of three maintenance professionals—two men and one woman—are standing near a large industrial motor and pump assembly. They are wearing clean, appropriate PPE including white hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One technician is pointing toward a specific part of the machinery while the others look on, engaged in a collaborative discussion. One technician is holding a rugged industrial tablet, but only the back of the device is visible to the camera. The lighting is bright and natural for an industrial setting, highlighting the metallic textures of the equipment and the professional demeanor of the staff. No text or logos are visible on the equipment or clothing. Full body shots of the professionals are shown.",
