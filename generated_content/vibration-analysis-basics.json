In the foreground, a reliability engineer (wearing a hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-visibility vest) is inspecting a large industrial electric motor. They are holding a tablet (back of the device visible, no screen content shown) in one hand and pointing a wireless vibration sensor mounted on the motor housing with the other. In the background, out of focus, other diverse technicians are working on a conveyor line. The lighting is cool industrial blue with warm highlights on the machinery, emphasizing technology and precision. No text or overlays in the image.",
