  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, professional image for a manufacturing facility's control room. A diverse team of three people, a Black woman acting as a maintenance manager, a Hispanic male technician, and an Asian female engineer, are gathered around a large digital dashboard on a wall screen. The screen displays charts and graphs related to MRO inventory levels, asset health, and predictive maintenance alerts. The people are pointing at the screen, engaged in a collaborative discussion. They are all wearing appropriate PPE for a plant environment, such as safety glasses and branded polo shirts. The lighting is clean and modern, highlighting the technology and the professional, data-driven nature of their work. The background is slightly blurred but shows clean, modern industrial equipment. There is no text on the image.",
