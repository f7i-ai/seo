  "image_prompt": "A high-end, photo-realistic wide shot of a modern industrial manufacturing floor in 2026. In the foreground, a diverse team of three maintenance professionals (two men, one woman) are inspecting a newly installed, large industrial pump and motor assembly. They are wearing clean, professional PPE including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One technician is pointing at a connection point on the pump while another holds a ruggedized industrial tablet (viewed from the back, showing a sleek carbon-fiber casing, no screen visible). The third technician is checking a sensor lead. The environment is brightly lit, clean, and organized, representing a high-tech \"brownfield\" facility. The background shows other machinery and a blurred overhead conveyor system. No text or logos are visible. Full-body shots of the professionals to show the scale of the equipment.",
