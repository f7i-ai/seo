  "image_prompt": "A high-quality, photorealistic image set in a bright, clean, modern manufacturing facility. A diverse team of two maintenance technicians, one male of South Asian descent and one female of Caucasian descent, are collaborating in front of a complex piece of industrial machinery. Both are wearing appropriate PPE: safety glasses, hard hats, and professional work uniforms. The female technician is holding a ruggedized tablet displaying graphs and data (no text visible), pointing to a specific point on the screen. The male technician is looking at the screen and then at a specific component on the machine, a thoughtful and engaged expression on his face. The background is slightly blurred to focus on the team, but other clean machinery and good lighting are visible. The overall mood is professional, proactive, and collaborative problem-solving, not an emergency repair.",
