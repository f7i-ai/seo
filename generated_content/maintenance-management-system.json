  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot of a modern manufacturing facility interior. The scene depicts a diverse group of maintenance engineers and technicians (men and women, various ethnicities) wearing modern PPE including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. They are standing near a large, complex industrial conveyor system. One technician is holding a tablet (back of device visible only) pointing toward a motor, while another points to a holographic-style overlay (implied, not sci-fi glowing) or a physical sensor on the machine. The lighting is professional industrial lighting, cool tones with warm accents on the machinery. No text or words in the image. The atmosphere conveys efficiency, technology, and safety.",
