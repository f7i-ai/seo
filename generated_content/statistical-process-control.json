  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot of a modern manufacturing facility floor. In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance engineers (men and women, various ethnicities) are wearing standard PPE (hard hats, safety glasses, high-vis vests). One engineer is holding a tablet, but the screen is not visible (facing away from the camera). They are looking at a large industrial motor and conveyor belt system. The background shows a clean, high-tech factory environment with blurred motion of machinery. The lighting is professional, with a mix of cool industrial blue and warm accent lighting. No text or overlays in the image. The atmosphere conveys reliability, technology, and teamwork.",
