  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a clean, modern industrial facility. In the foreground, a diverse maintenance team is preparing for a confined space entry near a large stainless steel tank. One technician (wearing a harness, hard hat, and safety glasses) is checking a handheld gas monitor (screen not visible). Another team member (the attendant) is holding a clipboard or tablet and standing near a tripod winch system set up over the manhole. The lighting is industrial but warm, highlighting the safety gear and the seriousness of the procedure. No text or words in the image. Background shows blurred industrial piping and machinery.",
