  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, professional wide shot inside a modern, brightly lit industrial manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse pair of maintenance professionals (one male, one female) are working together. They are wearing full PPE: clean white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility orange vests over navy blue work uniforms. The female professional is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet, but we only see the back of the device (no screen visible). They are standing next to a large, clean industrial pump/motor assembly. On the side of the motor, a small, stainless steel tag with a laser-etched Data Matrix code is clearly visible but not the focus. The background shows a clean, organized factory floor with more machinery and overhead conveyors, slightly out of focus to create depth. The lighting is natural and bright, conveying a sense of high-tech precision and safety. No text or logos in the image. Full body shots of the workers.",
