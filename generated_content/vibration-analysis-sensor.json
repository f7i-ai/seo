  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern industrial manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a close-up focus on a wireless vibration sensor mounted securely to the side of a large, blue electric motor. The sensor has a small LED indicator glowing soft green. In the slightly blurred background, a reliability technician wearing a hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-visibility vest is looking at a tablet, but the screen is not visible to the viewer. The lighting is professional industrial lighting, highlighting the texture of the metal motor and the sleek design of the sensor. No text or overlays.",
