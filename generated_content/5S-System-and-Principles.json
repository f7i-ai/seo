  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, wide-angle shot of a modern, high-tech manufacturing facility floor. The scene is bright, clean, and organized, exemplifying the 5S principles. In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance technicians (men and women) wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests are gathered. One technician is holding a tablet (back facing the camera) as if conducting a digital audit. In the background, automated machinery and yellow safety lines on the floor are clearly visible. The lighting is cool and industrial. No text or words should be visible in the image.",
