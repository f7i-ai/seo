Provisioning is the systematic process of preparing, configuring, and equipping industrial assets or digital systems with the resources required for immediate operational use. It encompasses the transition of an asset or user from a state of procurement to a state of active, monitored production within a facility.

### The Industrial Provisioning Framework
In the modern manufacturing landscape of 2026, provisioning has evolved beyond simple "setup." It is now viewed through the lens of **Operational Readiness**. This framework ensures that when a new piece of equipment is introduced to the floor, it is not merely physically present but is fully integrated into the facility’s digital and logistical ecosystem. This includes the synchronization of the Bill of Materials (BOM) with the warehouse, the assignment of maintenance schedules, and the configuration of data streams for real-time monitoring.

Effective provisioning reduces "time-to-value" for new capital expenditures. Without a robust provisioning strategy, organizations often face delays caused by missing spare parts, lack of technician access to technical manuals, or unconfigured sensors that fail to report to the central management system.

### Asset Provisioning vs. Digital Provisioning
In an industrial environment, provisioning typically branches into two distinct but overlapping paths:

1.  **Asset Provisioning:** This involves the physical and logistical preparation of machinery. It includes the allocation of MRO (Maintenance, Repair, and Operations) supplies and ensuring that the [inventory management](/features/inventory-management) system is stocked with critical spares identified in the asset's lifecycle plan. According to standards such as those outlined by [NIST](https://www.nist.gov/), resource provisioning must be scalable and resilient to ensure continuous operation.
2.  **Digital and User Provisioning:** This focuses on User Access Control (UAC) and software integration. It ensures that maintenance managers and facility operators have the correct permissions within the [CMMS software](/products/cmms-software) to trigger work orders, view telemetry, and manage [asset management](/features/asset-management) protocols. It also includes "Digital Twin Provisioning," where a virtual representation of the physical asset is configured to mirror real-world performance data.

### Why Provisioning Matters for Maintenance
For maintenance teams, provisioning is the foundation of proactive care. It ensures that [system integrations](/features/integrations) are seamless, allowing data to flow from the shop floor to the executive suite. When an asset is properly provisioned, the maintenance team inherits a "turnkey" system where PM (Preventive Maintenance) procedures are already documented, spare parts are linked to the asset record, and the equipment is ready for its first production cycle without administrative friction.
