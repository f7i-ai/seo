  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern industrial Coal Handling and Preparation Plant (CHPP). The focus is on a large, yellow industrial vibrating screen in operation. The environment is industrial—steel walkways, conveyor belts in the background, slightly dusty atmosphere but well-lit with industrial LED lighting. In the foreground, a reliability engineer (wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, high-vis orange vest, and gloves) is inspecting the side of the vibrating screen. They are holding a rugged tablet device (back of the device facing the camera) as if checking data. A small, wireless vibration sensor is visible mounted on the side plate of the screen. The image conveys technology meeting heavy industry. No text overlays. 16:9 aspect ratio.",
