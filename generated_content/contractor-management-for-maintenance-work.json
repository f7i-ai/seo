In the foreground, a facility manager in a white hard hat and safety vest is holding a tablet (back of device visible), gesturing towards a large piece of industrial machinery. Standing next to them is an external contractor in a different colored uniform (perhaps blue or grey) with a tool bag, also wearing full PPE including safety glasses and a hard hat. They are engaged in a professional discussion. The background shows a blurred but busy factory floor with yellow safety lines and modern equipment. The lighting is bright and industrial.
