  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern, clean manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance professionals (a woman in her 30s, a man in his 50s) are wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. They are standing near a large industrial conveyor system. The woman is holding a tablet (back of device visible only) and pointing toward a specific motor on the line, discussing strategy with her colleague. The background shows a busy but organized plant floor with blurred motion of machinery. The lighting is professional, combining cool industrial blue tones with warm highlights on the people. No text or overlays in the image. The atmosphere conveys competence, technology, and efficiency.",
