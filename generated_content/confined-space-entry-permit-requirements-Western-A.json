  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-resolution hero image set inside a modern industrial manufacturing facility in Western Australia. The scene features a diverse team of three maintenance professionals. One worker is wearing a full-body safety harness and a hard hat with a headlamp, preparing to enter a large stainless steel industrial tank (confined space). A second worker, the 'stand-by person', is standing just outside the tank entrance, wearing a high-visibility vest, safety glasses, and holding a ruggedized tablet (back of device visible) to monitor digital permit status. A third person, a supervisor, is pointing at a lockout/tagout (LOTO) station nearby. The lighting is a mix of cool industrial LED and warm accent lighting from the machinery. No text or words should be visible in the image. The atmosphere conveys safety, professionalism, and advanced technology.",
