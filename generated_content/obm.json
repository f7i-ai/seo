The scene features a diverse group of maintenance technicians and engineers (men and women of various ethnicities) wearing modern PPE including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. They are standing near a large, automated conveyor system and a robotic arm, looking at a tablet held by one of the engineers (only the back of the tablet is visible).
