  "image_prompt": "A professional, photo-realistic wide shot of a modern 2026 industrial manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are standing near a large, complex centrifugal pump system. They are wearing clean, professional PPE including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility orange vests over work uniforms. One technician is pointing toward a specific section of the pump while another holds a ruggedized industrial tablet (viewed from the back, showing a sleek carbon-fiber casing, no screen visible). The background shows a clean, well-lit factory floor with organized piping, yellow safety railings, and other high-tech machinery blurred slightly to create depth. The lighting is bright and natural, suggesting a high-end, technologically advanced workplace. No text or logos are visible. Full-body view of the professionals.",
