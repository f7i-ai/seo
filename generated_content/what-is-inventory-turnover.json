  "image_prompt": "A professional, photo-realistic wide shot of a modern industrial warehouse and maintenance storeroom. In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (one man, two women) are standing near a high-tech shelving unit. They are wearing clean, appropriate PPE including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility yellow vests over work shirts. One technician is holding a rugged industrial tablet, but only the back of the device is visible to the camera. The background shows organized rows of spare parts, motors, and gearboxes on industrial racking, with a clean polished concrete floor. The lighting is bright and industrial, conveying a sense of efficiency and high-tech organization. No text or screens are visible. Full body shots of the professionals.",
