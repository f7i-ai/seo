They are wearing appropriate PPE, including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. The maintenance manager is gesturing toward a large, well-maintained industrial pump system. One person is holding an industrial tablet (shown from the back, no screen visible). The lighting is bright and professional, highlighting the clean but used nature of the machinery. Full-body shot, showing the scale of the industrial environment. No text or words in the image.",
