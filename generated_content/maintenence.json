  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, wide-angle shot of a modern, high-tech manufacturing facility floor. In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (one female, two male) are wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. They are standing near a large, complex industrial machine (like a conveyor system or robotic arm). One technician is holding a tablet, showing the back of the device to the camera, while pointing at a specific component of the machine. The lighting is bright and industrial cool-white. The background shows blurred motion of other machinery, emphasizing a busy, productive environment. No text or words should be visible in the image.",
