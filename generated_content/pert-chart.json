  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, cinematic shot inside a modern manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance engineers (wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests) are gathered around a large, industrial-grade table. They are looking at a large, translucent digital holographic overlay projecting a complex network diagram (PERT chart) above a physical blueprint. The background shows blurred industrial machinery, perhaps a conveyor system or large pumps, emphasizing a brownfield environment. The lighting is professional, with cool blue tones from the hologram contrasting with the warm industrial lighting of the factory. One engineer is pointing at a \"Critical Path\" node on the hologram. No text or words should be visible on the displays. The atmosphere conveys collaboration, high-tech integration, and precision planning.",
