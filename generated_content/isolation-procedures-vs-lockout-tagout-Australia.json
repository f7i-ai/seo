In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance technicians (men and women) are wearing standard PPE including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One technician is focused on a large industrial motor, holding a red safety padlock, clearly demonstrating a Lockout/Tagout procedure. Another technician stands slightly behind, looking at a tablet (back of device visible only) which displays a digital checklist. The background shows a clean, busy factory floor with yellow safety walkways and industrial machinery (conveyors or pumps). The lighting is bright and professional, emphasizing safety and technology.
