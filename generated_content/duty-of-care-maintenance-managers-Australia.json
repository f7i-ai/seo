  "image_prompt": "A hyper-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern Australian manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance professionals (men and women) are wearing standard Australian PPE: high-visibility orange and yellow vests with reflective strips, white hard hats, and safety glasses. One technician is holding a rugged tablet, but the screen is facing away from the camera. They are looking at a large industrial motor connected to a conveyor belt. The background is slightly blurred but shows a clean, organized factory floor with yellow safety walkways.

The atmosphere conveys professionalism, safety, and technological control.",
