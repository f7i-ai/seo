  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern, clean manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of industrial professionals (a plant manager in a blazer and hard hat, and a maintenance technician in a blue uniform and safety glasses) are looking at a tablet held by the technician. The back of the tablet is visible, not the screen. They are standing next to a large, complex piece of industrial machinery (perhaps a conveyor system or a large pump) that has a small, glowing wireless sensor attached to it. The background is slightly blurred but shows a busy, high-tech factory floor with yellow safety lines and automated equipment. The lighting is professional and cool-toned, emphasizing technology and precision. No text or words in the image.",
