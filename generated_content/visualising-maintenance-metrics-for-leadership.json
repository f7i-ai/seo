  "image_prompt": "A high-quality, photorealistic image set in a modern manufacturing facility control room. In the foreground, a diverse group of professionals (a maintenance manager in a safety vest and hard hat, and two executives in business casual attire) are looking at a large, transparent glass digital display board. The display shows futuristic but readable data visualizations: a waterfall chart showing cost savings, a heat map of asset health (red/yellow/green dots), and a trend line going upward. The maintenance manager is pointing at the \"savings\" section of the chart, explaining it to the executives who look engaged and impressed. The background shows the blurred depth of a clean, high-tech factory floor with automated machinery. Lighting is professional, emphasizing the glow of the data and the collaborative atmosphere. No text should be legible on the screen, just the shapes of the charts.",
