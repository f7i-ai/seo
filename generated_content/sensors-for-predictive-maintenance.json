  "image_prompt": "A hyper-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers (men and women) wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests are inspecting a large industrial motor. One engineer is pointing to a small, wireless orange sensor magnetically attached to the motor housing. Another engineer holds a tablet (back facing camera) showing a data dashboard. The background features blurred automated assembly lines and soft industrial lighting. The atmosphere is clean, high-tech, and professional. No text or overlays in the image. 8k resolution, architectural photography style.",
