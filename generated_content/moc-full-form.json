  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, high-quality hero image for a blog post about Management of Change (MOC). The scene is a modern, clean manufacturing facility. A diverse team of three people—a male maintenance manager of South Asian descent in a blue polo, a female engineer of Caucasian descent with her hair tied back, and a male plant operator of African American descent—are gathered around a large industrial machine. They are all wearing appropriate PPE, including safety glasses and hard hats. The engineer is pointing to a digital tablet she is holding, which displays a technical diagram or workflow chart. The maintenance manager and operator are looking intently at the tablet, engaged in a serious discussion. The lighting is bright and professional, highlighting the clean environment and advanced technology. The background is slightly blurred to focus on the team and their interaction, suggesting a collaborative review process. No text or logos in the image.",
