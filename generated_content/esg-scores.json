  "image_prompt": "A professional, photo-realistic wide shot of a modern, clean industrial manufacturing floor in 2026. In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are standing near a large, high-tech robotic assembly arm. They are wearing clean, branded navy blue jumpsuits, white hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One technician is holding a rugged industrial tablet, but only the back of the device is visible. The facility is brightly lit with natural light from high windows and features visible green elements like indoor plants and recycling stations. The background shows other well-maintained machinery and a polished concrete floor. No text or screens are visible. The focus is on the collaboration and the clean, sustainable environment. Full-body shots of the professionals.",
