In the foreground, a diverse group of three professionals (a maintenance manager in a hard hat and safety vest, a plant director in business casual with safety glasses, and a finance officer in a suit with safety glasses) are looking at a large digital dashboard displayed on a tablet held by the manager (back of tablet visible only). The background shows blurred, clean automated machinery with subtle blue indicator lights, suggesting a high-tech environment.
