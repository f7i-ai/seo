In the foreground, a diverse team of two maintenance technicians (one male, one female) wearing full PPE (hard hats, safety glasses, high-visibility vests) are inspecting a large, orange 6-axis industrial robot arm. The female technician is holding a tablet (back of tablet visible) likely checking data, while the male technician is pointing a thermal imaging camera (back of device visible) at one of the robot's joints. The background shows a depth of field with other robots in operation, welding sparks, and digital dashboard screens displaying green status bars, emphasizing a high-tech, Industry 4.0 environment. Lighting is professional, cool industrial tones with warm highlights from the welding. No text overlays.",
