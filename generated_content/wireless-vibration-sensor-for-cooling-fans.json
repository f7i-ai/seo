In the foreground, a reliability engineer wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-visibility vest is looking at a tablet (screen not visible) while standing near a large industrial cooling tower. The focus is on the cooling tower fan housing where a small, sleek, industrial wireless vibration sensor is mounted. The background shows a blue sky and other industrial HVAC equipment. The lighting is natural sunlight, conveying a sense of modern, clean, and safe industrial maintenance. No text or overlays in the image.",
