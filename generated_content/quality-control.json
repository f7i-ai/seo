  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern, high-tech manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of two engineers (one male, one female) wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests are looking at a large industrial machine. The female engineer is holding a tablet, but only the back of the tablet is visible to the viewer. The background shows a clean, automated production line with blurred motion of robotic arms and conveyors. The lighting is cool and professional, with hints of blue and steel tones. No text or words should be visible in the image.",
