  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, professional image for a manufacturing facility in 2025. In the foreground, a female maintenance manager of Hispanic descent and a male technician of Black descent are standing side-by-side, looking at a tablet. Both are wearing safety glasses, hard hats, and high-visibility vests over their work uniforms. The tablet screen shows a graph of vibration data and a 3D model of an industrial fan. In the background, slightly out of focus, is a large, clean, well-lit industrial fan unit, part of an HVAC or dust collection system. The overall mood is professional, clean, high-tech, and collaborative. No text or words on the image.",
