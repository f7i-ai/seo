  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern, high-tech manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance professionals (a mix of genders and ethnicities) are gathered around a digital tablet held by one engineer (only the back of the tablet is visible). They are wearing modern PPE including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. They look focused and confident, discussing a strategy. In the background, blurred but visible, are large industrial machines, perhaps a conveyor system or large pumps, with subtle blue LED status lights indicating a futuristic 2026 setting. The lighting is professional and dramatic, highlighting the \"human element\" of technology and planning. No text or words in the image.",
