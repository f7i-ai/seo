In the foreground, a diverse team of two maintenance professionals—one man and one woman—are performing an inspection. They are wearing full appropriate PPE, including white hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility orange vests. One technician is gesturing toward a ruggedized metal control cabinet (the RTU enclosure) mounted on a pedestal, while the other holds a rugged industrial tablet (showing only the back of the device). The lighting is cinematic, highlighting the textures of the galvanized steel and the surrounding technical infrastructure. No text or displays are visible. Full body shots, professional atmosphere.",
