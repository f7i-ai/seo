In the foreground, a reliability engineer (wearing a hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-vis vest) is looking at a tablet held in their left hand (back of tablet visible, no screen content). They are gesturing with their right hand toward a large industrial electric motor connected to a pump system. The motor has a small, distinct wireless sensor attached to its housing.
