In the foreground, a maintenance technician wearing a hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-visibility vest is viewed from behind, holding a ruggedized tablet. The tablet screen is not visible. The technician is looking up at a large, complex piece of industrial machinery (like a conveyor system or large pump) that is clean and well-lit. In the background, another worker in similar PPE is inspecting a different section of the line. The lighting is professional and cool-toned, emphasizing a clean, high-tech, and organized environment.
