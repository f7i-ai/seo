  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, high-resolution image of a diverse team of three maintenance and engineering professionals in a bright, clean, modern factory setting. A female engineer of East Asian descent holds a tablet and points to its screen. A male maintenance manager of Caucasian descent with a polo shirt and a hard hat looks on intently. A younger male technician of Hispanic descent in clean overalls points to a large, complex industrial pump and motor assembly they are gathered around. All are wearing safety glasses. The mood is collaborative, professional, and proactive. The background is softly blurred, showing other industrial equipment. The lighting is bright and has a slightly cinematic quality. No text on screen or clothing.",
