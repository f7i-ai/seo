  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot of a modern industrial compressor room. The scene is clean and well-lit with cool industrial lighting. In the foreground, a diverse group of two maintenance engineers (one male, one female) wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests are looking at a large, mounted digital dashboard displaying complex energy graphs and airflow schematics. They are viewed from the side/back, not facing the camera directly. In the background, large industrial air compressors (rotary screw type) are visible, connected by color-coded piping (blue for air). The atmosphere conveys high-tech efficiency and professional maintenance operations. No text or words should be visible in the image.",
