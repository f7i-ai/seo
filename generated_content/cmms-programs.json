  "image_prompt": "A high-angle, wide-shot photo of a modern, clean industrial manufacturing floor in 2026. In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (two men, one woman) are huddled together in a collaborative discussion. They are wearing clean, professional uniforms, white hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One professional is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet, showing only the back of the device. In the background, large-scale automated machinery and robotic arms are visible, with soft, natural light coming from high warehouse windows. The atmosphere is professional, focused, and technologically advanced. No text or screens are visible. Full body shots of the professionals.",
