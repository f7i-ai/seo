  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, cinematic wide shot of a modern Coal Handling and Preparation Plant (CHPP) at dusk. The scene captures the complexity of the \"connected loop,\" featuring long overland conveyor belts stretching into the distance, a large washing plant structure with steel gantries, and stockpiles of coal. In the foreground, a reliability engineer in high-visibility orange PPE and a hard hat is inspecting a conveyor motor with a handheld tablet device, displaying a data dashboard. The lighting is industrial and dramatic, with safety lights illuminating the steel structures against a twilight sky. The atmosphere conveys heavy industry, precision, and technology.
