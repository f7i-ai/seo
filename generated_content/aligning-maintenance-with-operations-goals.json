  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern, high-tech manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of three professionals—a plant manager in a blazer and safety glasses, a maintenance technician in a blue uniform with a tool belt, and an operations supervisor in a high-vis vest—are standing around a large, holographic or digital dashboard screen displaying real-time production metrics and machinery health graphs. They are engaged in a collaborative discussion, pointing at the data, looking positive and focused. The background shows blurred automated machinery, robotic arms, and clean industrial lighting. No text in the image. 8k resolution, professional industrial photography style.",
