  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern industrial coal preparation plant (CHPP). The lighting is dramatic but professional, highlighting the scale of the machinery. In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers (men and women) wearing full mining PPE (hard hats, high-vis orange/yellow shirts with reflective strips, safety glasses, gloves) are inspecting a large, red centrifugal slurry pump. One engineer is pointing at a wireless sensor mounted on the bearing housing, while another holds a tablet (screen not visible) to log data. The background shows a complex network of large pipes, steel walkways, and conveyor belts. The atmosphere conveys technology meeting heavy industry. No text overlays.",
