## Federal Framework: Work Health and Safety

### The Model WHS Act

Australia's model Work Health and Safety Act has been adopted by the Commonwealth, all states (except Victoria), and the territories. This harmonised approach creates generally consistent requirements across most of Australia.

**Key Sections Relevant to Maintenance:**

**Section 19 - Primary Duty of Care:**
A person conducting a business or undertaking (PCBU) must ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the health and safety of workers and others affected by the conduct of the business. This includes:
- Providing and maintaining plant that is safe and without risks to health
- Providing and maintaining systems of work that are safe and without risks to health

**What This Means for Maintenance:**
The duty to "maintain" plant in safe condition implies an ongoing obligation, not a one-time activity. Equipment that degrades over time must be monitored and maintained to remain safe. Predictive maintenance provides documented evidence that you are actively managing equipment condition.

**Section 20-27 - Further Duties:**
Specific duties apply to designers, manufacturers, importers, suppliers, and installers of plant. Of particular relevance:
- Plant must be designed and manufactured to be capable of being maintained safely
- Information must be provided about the safe maintenance of plant

### WHS Regulations - Plant Requirements

The WHS Regulations contain detailed requirements for managing risks associated with plant (equipment).

**Regulation 203 - General Duty:**
A PCBU must manage risks to health and safety associated with using, handling, generating, storing or disposing of plant.

**Regulation 213 - Maintenance, Inspection and Testing:**
A PCBU with management or control of plant must ensure that:
- Maintenance, inspection and testing is carried out by a competent person
- Maintenance, inspection and testing is carried out having regard to the manufacturer's recommended procedures and the operating environment

**What This Means:**
You must maintain plant according to manufacturer recommendations, but also considering your specific operating environment. If your environment is harsher than typical (extreme heat, dust, washdown conditions), more frequent or more sophisticated monitoring may be required.

**Records and Documentation:**
Regulation 216 requires that records be kept of all inspections, testing and maintenance carried out on plant. These records must be kept:
- For the life of the plant (for registration-required plant)
- For a reasonable period (other plant)

Predictive maintenance systems automatically generate timestamped records of equipment condition, maintenance performed, and outcomes—providing superior documentation for compliance purposes.

## Victoria: Occupational Health and Safety Act 2004

Victoria is the only Australian jurisdiction that has not adopted the model WHS legislation. The Victorian Occupational Health and Safety Act 2004 (OHS Act) contains similar duties but with some differences in structure and terminology.

**Key Provisions:**

**Section 21 - Duties of Employers:**
An employer must, so far as is reasonably practicable, provide and maintain plant and systems of work that are safe and without risks to health.

**Section 26 - Equipment and Substances:**
An employer must maintain any plant that the employer provides in a safe condition.

**Practical Implications:**
While the Victorian provisions are substantively similar to the model WHS Act, there are differences in:
- Penalty structures
- Enforceable undertaking provisions
- Some specific regulations

If you operate in Victoria and other states, you need to ensure your maintenance documentation satisfies both Victorian OHS requirements and model WHS requirements applicable in other jurisdictions.

## Mining-Specific Regulations

Mining operations are subject to industry-specific regulations that impose additional maintenance requirements beyond general WHS.

### Western Australia

**Work Health and Safety Act 2020** (commenced March 2022)

Western Australia transitioned to the model WHS framework in March 2022, replacing the Mines Safety and Inspection Act 1994.

**Key Requirements:**
- PCBUs must ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that plant is maintained in a safe condition
- Regular inspections of plant must be conducted and documented
- Defects must be reported and rectified

**Work Health and Safety (Mines) Regulations 2022:**
- Specific inspection requirements for various plant types
- Requirements for competent persons to conduct inspections
- Record-keeping requirements
- Principal hazard management plans for mining operations

**Resources Safety Division:**
The Department of Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety administers mining safety in WA. Inspectors have broad powers to require maintenance improvements where they identify deficiencies.

### Queensland

**Mining and Quarrying Safety and Health Act 1999**

This Act applies to all mines and quarries in Queensland. Key provisions:

**Safety and Health Management System (Section 62):**
The site senior executive must develop and implement a safety and health management system that includes provisions for:
- Inspection and maintenance of plant
- Training in plant maintenance
- Record-keeping

**Coal Mining Safety and Health Act 1999**

Coal mines have additional requirements under this specific legislation:

**Section 42 - Coal Mine Safety and Health Management System:**
Must include management of plant and equipment hazards, including maintenance procedures.

**Principal Hazard Management Plans:**
Where plant is associated with a principal hazard (fires, explosions, strata failure, etc.), specific management plans are required that address maintenance.

### New South Wales

**Work Health and Safety (Mines and Petroleum Sites) Act 2013**

This Act applies to mines and petroleum sites in NSW.

**Safety Management Systems (Clause 9):**
Operators must prepare and implement a safety management system that is designed to, among other things:
- Identify hazards including those related to plant
- Manage risks including through maintenance strategies

**Principal Control Plans (Schedule 2):**
Various principal hazards require control plans, many of which have maintenance implications:
- Ground or strata failure
- Inundation or inrush of any substance
- Fire or explosion

**Mining and Petroleum Competence Board:**
Oversees competency requirements for key positions, including those with maintenance responsibilities.

## Food Safety Regulations

### FSANZ - Food Standards Code

Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) sets food standards applicable across Australia and New Zealand.

**Standard 3.2.2 - Food Safety Practices and General Requirements:**

**Division 6 - Health and Hygiene Requirements:**
Premises, fixtures, fittings and equipment must be maintained in good working order.

**Division 7 - Cleaning, Sanitising and Maintenance:**
Equipment must be maintained in good repair to enable cleaning and, if necessary, sanitising.

### State Food Acts

Each state and territory has its own Food Act that implements the national standards and adds jurisdiction-specific requirements:

- **NSW:** Food Act 2003
- **VIC:** Food Act 1984
- **QLD:** Food Act 2006
- **WA:** Food Act 2008
- **SA:** Food Act 2001
- **TAS:** Food Act 2003

**Common Requirements:**
- Food businesses must maintain food premises and equipment in a good state of repair
- Maintenance activities must not contaminate food
- Documentation of maintenance affecting food safety

**HACCP Integration:**
For facilities operating under HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points), maintenance is directly integrated into food safety management:
- Equipment failures at Critical Control Points (CCPs) create food safety risks
- Maintenance must be documented as part of the HACCP record-keeping
- Corrective actions for equipment failures must be documented

## Documentation Requirements for Compliance

Regardless of specific regulations, consistent documentation practices support compliance across frameworks.

### What to Document

**Equipment Identification:**
- Asset register with unique identifiers
- Equipment specifications and criticality ratings
- Manufacturer maintenance recommendations

**Condition Monitoring:**
- Sensor readings and trends
- Anomalies detected and alerts generated
- Baseline values and threshold settings

**Maintenance Activities:**
- Work orders generated (including predictive alerts)
- Tasks performed with dates and personnel
- Parts used and replaced
- Test results and verification

**Outcomes:**
- Equipment condition post-maintenance
- Verification that maintenance achieved intended outcome
- Any defects identified and corrective actions

### Retention Periods

Different regulations specify different retention periods:

| Regulation Type | Typical Retention | Notes |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------|
| WHS Plant Records | Life of plant | For registrable plant |
| Mining Records | 7 years minimum | Some records longer |
| Food Safety | 2-7 years | Varies by state/HACCP |
| Pressure Equipment | Life of plant | AS 3788 requirements |

**Best Practice:**
Maintain electronic records indefinitely. Storage costs are negligible compared to the compliance and legal value of historical records.

## How Predictive Maintenance Supports Compliance

### Demonstrating Reasonable Practicability

The WHS duty is qualified by "so far as is reasonably practicable." This balances the likelihood and severity of harm against the cost of eliminating risk.

**Predictive Maintenance Strengthens Your Position:**
- Demonstrates proactive monitoring rather than reactive response
- Provides documented evidence of equipment condition over time
- Shows investment in appropriate technology to manage risk
- Creates audit trail for regulatory inspections

### Superior Documentation

Traditional maintenance records often consist of paper work orders and manual log entries. These are:
- Subject to human error
- Difficult to analyse for trends
- May be lost or damaged
- Hard to prove authenticity in disputes

Predictive maintenance platforms provide:
- Automatic timestamped records
- Continuous condition data (not just point-in-time)
- Digital audit trails
- Data analytics for pattern identification

### Early Hazard Identification

WHS regulations emphasise hazard identification and risk assessment. Predictive maintenance identifies developing hazards (degrading equipment) before they manifest as incidents.

This aligns with the hierarchy of controls—elimination and substitution are preferred to administrative controls and PPE. Predicting and preventing failures is superior to managing failed equipment.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does Australian law require predictive maintenance?

No Australian regulation explicitly mandates predictive maintenance. However, the duty to maintain plant in safe condition, combined with the "reasonably practicable" test, creates strong incentives for proactive maintenance strategies. For high-risk industries or critical equipment, predictive maintenance may represent the standard of care expected.

### Which Australian Standard covers predictive maintenance?

There is no specific Australian Standard for predictive maintenance as a discipline. However, various standards address condition monitoring techniques (ISO 10816 for vibration, AS 3788 for pressure equipment inspection) that form components of predictive maintenance programs.

### How long must I keep maintenance records in Australia?

Requirements vary by regulation and equipment type. For registrable plant under WHS, records must be kept for the life of the plant. Mining regulations typically require 7+ years. Food safety may require 2-7 years depending on jurisdiction. Best practice is to maintain electronic records indefinitely.

### What happens if I don't maintain equipment properly?

Failure to maintain equipment can result in: (1) Regulatory enforcement including improvement or prohibition notices, (2) Prosecution for WHS breaches with significant penalties (up to millions for corporations), (3) Civil liability for injuries or damage, (4) Insurance implications including coverage disputes.
