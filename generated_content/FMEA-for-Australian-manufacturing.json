  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot of a modern Australian manufacturing facility interior. The scene features a diverse group of reliability engineers and technicians (men and women) wearing standard Australian PPE: high-visibility yellow and orange vests with reflective strips, hard hats, and safety glasses. They are standing near a large industrial conveyor system and a heavy-duty compressor. One technician is looking at the back of a ruggedized tablet held in their hand (screen not visible), while pointing at a sensor mounted on a motor. The lighting is a mix of natural light from high skylights and cool industrial LED lighting. The atmosphere is clean, organized, and high-tech. No text or overlays in the image. Focus on the interaction between the people and the machinery.",
