  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern, clean manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers and maintenance technicians (wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-vis vests) are gathered around a large industrial motor and pump assembly. They are not frantically fixing it; they are calmly analyzing it. One engineer is pointing at a specific component while holding a tablet (back of tablet visible only). Another technician is using a handheld thermal imaging camera (screen not visible) to inspect the motor casing. In the background, automated production lines are running smoothly, slightly blurred to emphasize the focus on the team. The lighting is professional industrial lighting, with a cool blue hue accented by warm safety yellows. The atmosphere conveys competence, technology, and control, not chaos. No text or overlays.",
