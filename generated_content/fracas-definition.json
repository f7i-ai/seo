In the foreground, a diverse team of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are standing near a large, complex centrifugal pump system. They are wearing clean, professional PPE including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility yellow vests over work shirts. One technician is pointing toward a specific section of the pump, while another holds a ruggedized industrial tablet (shown from the back, no screen visible). The background shows a clean, well-lit factory environment with various pipes, motors, and a conveyor system in the distance. The lighting is bright and natural, conveying a sense of organized, high-tech industrial efficiency. No text or logos are visible.",
