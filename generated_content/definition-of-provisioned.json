  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, professional photograph of a modern industrial manufacturing floor. In the foreground, a diverse pair of maintenance professionals (one male, one female) are standing near a large, well-maintained centrifugal pump. They are wearing full PPE, including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility orange vests over work shirts. One professional is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet (showing only the back of the device), while the other is pointing toward a small, unobtrusive IIoT vibration sensor mounted on the pump's bearing housing. The background shows a clean, organized factory environment with overhead conveyors and various pipes, softly blurred to keep focus on the professionals and the equipment. The lighting is bright and natural, conveying a sense of efficiency and technological advancement. No text or logos are visible. Full body shots of the professionals are shown.",
