In the foreground, a diverse team of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are collaborating. They are wearing clean, professional PPE including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility yellow vests over work shirts. One person is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet (viewed from the back, showing a sleek black protective case, no screen visible). They are standing near a large, well-maintained industrial motor and pump assembly. The background shows a clean, organized factory environment with overhead conveyors and soft, natural industrial lighting. The atmosphere is one of focused, high-tech collaboration.
