  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern industrial manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a focused reliability engineer (wearing safety glasses, hard hat, and high-vis vest) is holding a ruggedized tablet displaying complex data visualizations and a 3D \"digital twin\" wireframe of a large electric motor. In the background, slightly out of focus, is the actual large industrial motor and pump assembly with visible wireless sensors attached to the cooling fins. The lighting is dramatic but professional, highlighting the connection between the physical machine and the digital analysis. No text overlays. The atmosphere conveys precision, technology, and industrial scale.",
