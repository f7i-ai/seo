  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers (men and women) wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests are walking through an aisle of industrial machinery. The lighting is a mix of cool industrial blue and warm amber safety lights. In the background, blurred slightly, are large conveyors and piping systems. The engineer in the center is holding a rugged tablet, but only the back of the device is visible (no screen content). The image conveys a sense of organized, high-tech industrial discipline.
