  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern industrial manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance planners and technicians (wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-vis vests) are gathered around a large digital tablet or table, but we only see the back of the device, focusing on their engagement.

The lighting is dramatic but professional, highlighting the complexity of the industrial environment. The atmosphere conveys serious planning and collaboration. No text or overlays in the image.",
