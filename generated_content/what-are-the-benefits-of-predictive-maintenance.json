  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot of a modern manufacturing plant floor. In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers and maintenance technicians (men and women) are wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One technician is inspecting a large industrial motor, holding a tablet (back of device visible only). In the background, blurred assembly lines and robotic arms are in motion. The lighting is professional and industrial, with a mix of cool blue factory lighting and warm highlights on the machinery. No text or words in the image. Atmosphere conveys efficiency, technology, and safety.",
