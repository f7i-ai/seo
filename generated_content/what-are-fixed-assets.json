In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are standing near a large industrial motor and pump assembly. They are wearing clean hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One professional is pointing toward the machinery while another holds a ruggedized industrial tablet (showing only the back of the device). The background shows a well-organized production line with conveyors and overhead structures. The lighting is bright and professional, emphasizing a high-tech, efficient industrial environment. No text or logos are visible on the equipment or clothing. Full body shots of the professionals are visible.",
