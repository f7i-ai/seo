  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, professional image for a manufacturing blog post. A diverse team of three maintenance professionals, one woman of East Asian descent and two men, one of Black and one of Caucasian descent, are gathered around a large industrial electric motor and pump in a clean, modern factory setting. The woman is pointing to a small, sleek, modern wireless vibration and temperature sensor mounted on the motor's bearing housing. She is holding a tablet displaying colorful vibration data graphs. All three are wearing safety glasses, and the men are wearing hard hats. The lighting is bright and focused on the team and the equipment, with the factory floor softly blurred in the background. The mood is collaborative and high-tech. No text on the image.",
