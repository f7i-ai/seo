  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-resolution image of a modern manufacturing facility interior. In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers (men and women) wearing standard PPE (hard hats, safety glasses, high-visibility vests) are gathered around a large industrial motor. One engineer is pointing at a specific component of the motor, while another holds a tablet (back of the tablet visible only) as if referencing data. The background shows a clean, active production line with conveyors and automated machinery. The lighting is bright and industrial, highlighting the professionalism and technology-forward nature of the scene. No text or overlays in the image.",
