The scene features a diverse group of three industrial workers (two men, one woman) conducting a safety briefing near a yellow walkway gantry. They are wearing full PPE including hard hats, high-visibility orange shirts with reflective strips, safety glasses, and safety harnesses. One worker is holding a ruggedized tablet (back of device visible only) showing a digital checklist, while pointing up toward an overhead conveyor system. The background shows heavy industrial machinery, steel structures, and blue sky. The lighting is natural and bright, emphasizing safety and professionalism. No text or words in the image.",
