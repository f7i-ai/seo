  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, high-detail image of a modern, clean industrial facility like a compressor hall. In the foreground, a female reliability engineer with dark hair in a ponytail and a male reliability engineer of South Asian descent are working on a large, green reciprocating compressor. Both are wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests over their professional work shirts. The male engineer is holding a modern vibration data collector with a screen, looking intently at the readings. The female engineer is carefully placing a magnetic-base accelerometer onto the compressor's main bearing housing. The lighting is bright and professional, highlighting the technology and the focused, collaborative effort of the diverse team. The background is slightly out of focus, showing other industrial equipment. There is no text on the image.",
