  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern, high-tech food processing facility. The scene focuses on a stainless steel sanitary pump and motor assembly. A reliability engineer, wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, ear protection, and a white hygienic lab coat, is inspecting a small, cylindrical stainless steel sensor mounted on the equipment. The engineer is holding a tablet (back of tablet visible) likely checking data. The background shows clean, gleaming stainless steel piping and conveyor systems. The lighting is bright and clinical, typical of a food plant, with a slight cool blue tint to emphasize hygiene and technology. No text in the image.",
