  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern paper mill. In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers and mill managers (wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests) are looking at a tablet held by one of them (we see the back of the tablet, not the screen). They are standing on a mezzanine walkway overlooking a massive, fast-moving paper machine web. The lighting is industrial but dramatic, highlighting the steam rising from the dryer section and the massive scale of the machinery. The atmosphere conveys serious professionalism and advanced technology integration. No text or overlays.",
