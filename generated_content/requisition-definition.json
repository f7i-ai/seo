In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance engineers (men and women) wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests are gathered around a large industrial conveyor system. One engineer is holding a tablet (back of device visible only) pointing toward a motor, while another points to a specific component. The background shows a clean, high-tech factory floor with blurred motion of automated machinery. The lighting is professional and cool-toned, emphasizing a clean and efficient industrial environment. No text or overlays in the image.",
