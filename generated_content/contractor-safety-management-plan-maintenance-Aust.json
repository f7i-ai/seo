  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern Australian manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of three professionals: a Maintenance Manager (male, 40s), a Safety Officer (female, 30s), and a Contractor (male, 20s). They are wearing standard Australian PPE: high-visibility vests with reflective strips, hard hats, and safety glasses. The Contractor is holding a rugged tablet (back facing camera) showing a green \"Compliance Verified\" checkmark interface. They are standing in front of a large industrial conveyor system. The background is clean but clearly an active \"brownfield\" factory with yellow safety walkways and industrial machinery. Lighting is professional and bright, highlighting the safety culture. No text or words should be visible in the environment.",
