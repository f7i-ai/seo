The scene features a diverse group of three industrial professionals (a plant manager in a white hard hat, a maintenance technician in a blue hard hat, and an operations lead in a yellow hard hat) standing on a walkway overlooking a clean, automated production line. They are wearing safety glasses and high-visibility vests. The technician is holding a tablet, but only the back of the device is visible.
