  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, photo-realistic hero image of a modern industrial manufacturing environment. In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are standing near a large, complex piece of machinery (a multi-stage industrial pump or motor). They are wearing clean, professional PPE: white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility yellow vests over work shirts. One technician is pointing toward a specific component of the machine while the others look on, engaged in a collaborative discussion. One technician is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet, but only the back of the device is visible to the camera. The lighting is bright and professional, highlighting the clean, well-organized factory floor. The background shows other machinery and overhead conveyors, slightly out of focus to create depth. No text or logos are visible on the equipment or clothing. Full-body or three-quarter shots of the people.",
