  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, cinematic wide shot of a modern industrial manufacturing floor. In the foreground, a reliability engineer in a hard hat and safety vest is looking at a ruggedized tablet displaying a complex data topology map (nodes and connections). In the background, blurred but visible, are large industrial machines (conveyors, robotic arms) with glowing digital overlays indicating data flow (subtle blue lines connecting machines to an edge gateway). The lighting is industrial but dramatic, mixing cool server-room blues with warm factory floor ambers. No text in the image. High detail, 8k resolution.",
