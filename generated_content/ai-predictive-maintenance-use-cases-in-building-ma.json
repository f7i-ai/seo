  "image_prompt": "A wide-angle, photorealistic shot inside a modern, clean cement plant control room. In the foreground, a diverse team of three maintenance professionals—a middle-aged white man, a young Black woman, and an Asian man in his 40s—are gathered around a large, ruggedized tablet. They are all wearing hard hats and safety glasses. The woman is pointing to a complex graph on the tablet screen, which displays vibration data and an AI-generated health score for a piece of equipment. In the background, large screens show a digital twin of the plant with a rotary kiln and crushers highlighted. The lighting is bright and professional, conveying a sense of high-tech competence and collaboration.",
