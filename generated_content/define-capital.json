  "image_prompt": "A hyper-realistic, cinematic wide shot of a modern manufacturing plant floor. The scene features a diverse group of three professionals: a Maintenance Manager (male, 40s), a Plant Director (female, 30s), and a Technician (male, 20s). They are wearing standard PPE including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. They are standing near a large, complex industrial conveyor system and motor assembly. The Plant Director is pointing toward the machinery, discussing strategy. The Technician is holding a ruggedized tablet (back of tablet visible only) at his side. The lighting is dramatic but professional, highlighting the metallic textures of the machinery (physical capital). No text or words in the image. 8k resolution, architectural photography style.",
