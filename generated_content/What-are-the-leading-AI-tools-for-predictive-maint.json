  "image_prompt": "A hyper-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern food and beverage manufacturing facility. The scene features a diverse group of reliability engineers and plant managers (men and women of various ethnicities) wearing white sanitary lab coats, hair nets, safety glasses, and hard hats. They are standing near a large, stainless steel bottling line and conveyor system. One engineer is holding a tablet (back of device visible only) pointing toward a motor, implying a digital scan. The environment is gleaming clean, reflecting the \"washdown\" nature of the industry, with silver pipes and digital sensor nodes attached to machinery. The lighting is bright, cool industrial LED, highlighting the cleanliness and high-tech nature of the plant. No text or overlays in the image.",
