  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern, high-tech manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a reliability engineer (wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-visibility vest) is inspecting a large industrial motor and gearbox assembly. The engineer is holding a ruggedized tablet (back of tablet visible, no screen content shown) and looking at a sensor mounted on the gearbox. In the background, slightly out of focus, other technicians in PPE are working on a conveyor line. The lighting is a mix of cool industrial LED and warm ambient light, highlighting the metallic textures of the machinery. The atmosphere conveys precision, technology, and industrial scale.
