In the foreground, a diverse group of industrial engineers and data scientists (wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests) are gathered around a large industrial turbine. One engineer is holding a ruggedized tablet (back facing camera) pointing at the machine. Superimposed subtly in the air near the machine are holographic-style data visualizations (wireframe graphs, efficiency percentages) representing \"Edge AI\" processing. The background shows a busy factory floor with automated conveyors and robotic arms, slightly blurred to emphasize depth. The lighting is a mix of cool industrial blue LEDs and warm amber safety lights. High resolution, 8k, professional architectural photography style.",
