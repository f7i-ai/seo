In the foreground, a reliability engineer (wearing a hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-visibility vest) is inspecting a large industrial electric motor. The engineer is holding a tablet (screen not visible) in one hand and looking at a wireless vibration sensor mounted on the motor housing. In the background, blurred slightly, other diverse technicians are working on machinery. The lighting is cool industrial blue with warm highlights on the machinery, emphasizing technology and precision. No text or overlays.",
