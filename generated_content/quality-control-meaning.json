  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, photo-realistic hero image of a modern industrial manufacturing floor. In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are standing near a large, well-maintained industrial motor and pump assembly. They are wearing clean, professional PPE including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility yellow vests over work shirts. One technician is pointing toward a specific part of the machinery, while another holds a ruggedized industrial tablet (shown from the back, no screen visible). The background shows a clean, organized factory environment with conveyors and overhead piping, softly blurred to keep focus on the team. The lighting is bright and natural, conveying a sense of precision, reliability, and advanced technology. No text or logos are visible on the equipment or clothing. Full-body or three-quarter shots to show the professional environment.",
