  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern, clean industrial manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance professionals (wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests) are gathered around a large industrial machine. One professional is holding a tablet (back of device visible only) and pointing toward a specific component on the machine, discussing a part requirement with a colleague who is taking notes on a clipboard. In the background, blurred slightly to create depth, are automated conveyor belts and yellow safety railings. The lighting is bright and industrial, highlighting the professionalism and technical nature of the environment. No text or overlays in the image.",
