  "image_prompt": "A high-quality, photorealistic image set in a clean, modern manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a female reliability engineer of South Asian descent and a male maintenance manager of Caucasian descent are looking at a tablet displaying a colorful vibration spectrum graph. They are both wearing safety glasses, hard hats, and high-visibility vests. In the background, slightly out of focus, is a large industrial electric motor with a technician of African descent wearing proper PPE, pointing towards the bearing housing. The lighting is bright and professional, highlighting the advanced technology and collaborative nature of modern maintenance. The overall mood is one of focused, data-driven problem-solving.
