  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern Australian manufacturing facility. The scene features a diverse group of maintenance engineers and plant managers (men and women) wearing standard high-visibility vests, hard hats, and safety glasses. They are standing near a large industrial conveyor belt system with a large electric motor. One engineer is pointing at a specific component on the motor where a small wireless sensor is attached. Another engineer is holding a tablet (showing only the back of the device, no screen visible) as if checking data. The lighting is professional and industrial, with a mix of cool factory lighting and warm highlights. The atmosphere is collaborative and focused on technology. No text or words should appear in the image. Background includes blurred industrial machinery to emphasize depth.",
