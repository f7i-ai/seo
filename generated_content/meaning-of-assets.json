  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, photo-realistic wide shot of a modern industrial manufacturing floor. In the foreground, a diverse team of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are standing near a large, complex centrifugal pump system. They are all wearing appropriate PPE: white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility orange vests over work shirts. One technician is pointing toward a specific part of the pump while another holds a ruggedized industrial tablet (viewed from the back, showing a black protective casing with no screen visible). The third technician is looking at the pump's motor housing. The background shows a clean, well-lit \"brownfield\" factory environment with overhead conveyors and piping. The lighting is bright and professional, emphasizing a culture of safety and high-tech reliability. No text or logos are visible on the equipment or clothing. Full-body view of the professionals.",
