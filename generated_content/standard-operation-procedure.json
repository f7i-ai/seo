  "image_prompt": "A professional, photo-realistic wide shot of a modern industrial manufacturing floor in 2026. In the foreground, a diverse team of two maintenance professionals (one male, one female) are collaborating near a large, complex centrifugal pump system. They are wearing clean, professional PPE: white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility vests over navy blue work uniforms. One technician is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet, but we only see the back of the device, which features a hand strap and a reinforced casing. The other technician is pointing toward a specific component of the machinery. The background shows a clean, well-lit facility with other high-tech machinery and yellow safety floor markings. No text or screens are visible. The lighting is bright and natural, conveying a sense of precision and safety. Full-body view of the technicians.",
