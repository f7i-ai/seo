  "image_prompt": "A high-angle, professional photograph of a modern industrial facility interior in the Vallejo-i district of Mexico City. The scene features a clean, well-organized production floor with a mix of legacy and modern machinery. In the foreground, a diverse group of three industrial engineers (two men, one woman) are conducting a floor walk. They are wearing full PPE, including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility yellow vests. One engineer is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet, showing only the back of the device. The lighting is bright and natural, coming from high clerestory windows. The background shows large stainless steel storage tanks and a network of overhead conveyors. The overall atmosphere is one of efficiency, safety, and advanced technology. Photo-realistic, 8k resolution, no text or overlays.",
