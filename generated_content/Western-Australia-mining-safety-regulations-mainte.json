  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot of a modern mining processing plant in Western Australia. In the foreground, a diverse group of three mining professionals (an Engineering Manager, a Maintenance Superintendent, and a Technician) are standing safely on a walkway. They are wearing full PPE including orange high-visibility shirts with reflective strips, hard hats, and safety glasses. The Technician is holding a rugged tablet, showing the back of the device (no screen visible). In the background, large industrial conveyor belts and crushing equipment are visible, with a subtle digital overlay or \"digital twin\" wireframe effect on one of the machines to symbolize the \"Digital Chain of Evidence.\" The lighting is golden hour, suggesting a 24/7 operation. The image conveys safety, technology, and industrial scale. No text in the image.",
