  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, professional wide shot of a modern, clean industrial manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are standing near a large, complex piece of machinery (a multi-stage centrifugal pump system). They are wearing full appropriate PPE, including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility orange vests over work uniforms. One technician is pointing toward a specific component of the machine while another holds a ruggedized industrial tablet (showing only the back of the device). The lighting is bright and natural, highlighting the stainless steel surfaces of the equipment. The background shows a well-organized plant floor with yellow safety lines and other blurred machinery, conveying a sense of scale and high-tech precision. No text or displays are visible.",
