  "image_prompt": "A wide-angle, photo-realistic shot of a modern, clean industrial manufacturing floor. In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (one female, two male) are standing near a large, complex piece of machinery. They are wearing full professional PPE: white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility neon vests over work uniforms. One technician is pointing toward a specific section of the machine while another holds a ruggedized tablet (viewed from the back, showing a sturdy black protective case, no screen visible). The lighting is bright and professional, highlighting the metallic textures of the equipment. The background shows a well-organized production line with other workers in the distance, all wearing appropriate safety gear. No text or logos are visible on the equipment or clothing. Full body shots of the professionals are shown.",
