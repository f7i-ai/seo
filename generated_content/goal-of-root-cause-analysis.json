In the foreground, a diverse group of three professionals (a reliability engineer in a white hard hat, a maintenance technician in a blue uniform and safety glasses, and an operations manager in a high-vis vest) are gathered around a large industrial pump system. They are looking at a tablet held by the engineer (screen not visible) and pointing at a specific component of the machine, engaged in a serious, collaborative discussion. The background shows blurred automated production lines with soft, cool industrial lighting. The atmosphere conveys professionalism, problem-solving, and technology integration. No text or overlays.
