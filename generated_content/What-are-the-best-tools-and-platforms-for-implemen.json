  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern, clean manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers and maintenance technicians (wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests) are gathered around a large industrial motor. One technician is pointing at a wireless vibration sensor attached to the motor housing. Another is holding a tablet (back of tablet visible only) showing a data graph. In the background, automated conveyor belts and robotic arms are in motion, slightly blurred to emphasize depth. The lighting is cool industrial blue with warm highlights on the people and the sensor, symbolizing the merger of technology and human expertise. No text or overlays in the image. 8k resolution.",
