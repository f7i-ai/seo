  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern industrial ammonia refrigeration engine room. In the foreground, a reliability engineer wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-visibility vest is inspecting a large blue compressor. The engineer is holding a tablet (screen not visible) looking at a digital gauge on the pipe. In the background, rows of color-coded insulated piping (yellow for ammonia) run along the ceiling. The lighting is industrial but clean, with cool blue tones contrasting with the yellow pipes. No text overlays. The atmosphere conveys precision and high-tech maintenance.",
