  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern industrial manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a reliability engineer wearing a hard hat, safety glasses, and arc-flash rated clothing is inspecting a large electrical panel. They are holding a tablet (back of device visible) that displays a complex data visualization. In the background, out of focus, are automated conveyor lines and machinery. The lighting is industrial but dramatic, highlighting the clean, high-tech nature of modern maintenance. No text or overlays in the image. The atmosphere conveys precision and safety.",
