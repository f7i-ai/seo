  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern industrial manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a focus on a large, blue industrial electric motor. Attached to the cooling fins of the motor is a small, sleek, orange wireless vibration sensor with a blinking green LED status light. The background is slightly blurred (bokeh effect) showing a diverse team of maintenance engineers (men and women) wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One engineer is looking at a tablet (back of tablet visible) while pointing toward the machinery, discussing data. The lighting is a mix of cool industrial LED and warm ambient light, highlighting the texture of the machinery and the modern sensor technology. No text or overlays.",
