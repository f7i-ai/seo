  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, high-resolution image set in a clean, modern factory. A diverse maintenance team of two, a man of South Asian descent and a woman of Caucasian descent, are standing in front of a large, blue industrial electric motor. The woman is holding a ruggedized tablet displaying colorful vibration spectrum graphs (FFT) and trend lines, with no text visible. She is pointing at the screen, discussing the data with the man. The man is looking intently at the tablet and then at the motor, engaged in the conversation. Both are wearing appropriate PPE: white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility yellow vests over their navy blue work uniforms. The lighting is bright and professional, and the background showing other industrial equipment is slightly blurred to focus on the team and the motor. The overall mood is collaborative, high-tech, and proactive.",
