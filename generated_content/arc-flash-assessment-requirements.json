In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance technicians and a facility manager are gathered around a large electrical panel. They are wearing appropriate PPE, including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One technician is pointing to a new, clearly visible \"Arc Flash Hazard\" warning label on the panel, while holding a tablet (back of tablet visible only). The facility manager looks engaged, holding a digital multimeter. The background shows blurred production machinery and clean, well-lit factory aisles, emphasizing a culture of safety and organization. No text overlays. Professional lighting with a slight cool blue tone for the industrial setting, contrasted with the warm yellow of the safety gear.",
