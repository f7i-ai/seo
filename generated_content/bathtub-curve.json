  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, photo-realistic wide shot of a modern, clean industrial manufacturing facility in 2026. In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (two men, one woman) are standing near a large, complex industrial pump system. They are wearing full professional PPE: white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility orange vests over navy blue work uniforms. One technician is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet (showing only the back of the device), while another is pointing toward a sensor mounted on the pump. The lighting is bright and professional, highlighting the stainless steel surfaces of the machinery. No text or digital overlays are visible. The focus is on the collaborative, high-tech nature of modern reliability engineering. Full body shots, professional posture.",
