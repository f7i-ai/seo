  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, professional hero image of a modern industrial manufacturing environment. In the foreground, a diverse pair of maintenance professionals (one male, one female) are standing near a large, complex piece of machinery (like a high-speed bottling line or a large industrial compressor). They are wearing full PPE, including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility yellow vests. One professional is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet, showing only the back of the device to the camera. They are engaged in a professional discussion, looking at the machinery. The background shows a clean, well-lit factory floor with other equipment and a sense of scale. The lighting is bright and natural, emphasizing a high-tech, efficient atmosphere. No text or words are visible in the image. Full-body or three-quarter view.",
