  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-resolution image inside a modern manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance engineers (men and women) wearing standard PPE (hard hats, safety glasses, high-visibility vests) are inspecting a large industrial motor and pump assembly. One engineer is holding a tablet device, but only the back of the device is visible (no screen content). The background shows a clean, busy factory floor with blurred machinery and piping. The lighting is professional and industrial, highlighting the metallic textures of the equipment. No text or words should be visible in the image. The mood is focused, professional, and technologically advanced.",
