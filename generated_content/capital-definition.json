  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern, clean manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of three professionals are standing near a large, complex industrial machine (perhaps a compressor or automated assembly line). One person is a maintenance manager wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-visibility vest, holding a tablet (back of tablet visible only). They are pointing at a specific component of the machine. Next to them is a person in business casual attire (representing finance/CFO) wearing safety glasses and a visitor vest, listening intently. The third person is a technician in blue coveralls and PPE, checking a sensor on the machine. The lighting is dramatic but professional, highlighting the interplay between the human element and the high-value capital assets. No text or overlays in the image. The atmosphere conveys collaboration and strategic decision-making.",
