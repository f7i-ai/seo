  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers (men and women) wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests are inspecting a large, industrial blue induction motor connected to a pump system. One engineer is holding a tablet (back facing the camera) while pointing at the motor cooling fins. In the background, blurred automated conveyor lines and soft industrial lighting create a clean, high-tech atmosphere. No text or overlays in the image. 8k resolution, professional industrial photography style.",
