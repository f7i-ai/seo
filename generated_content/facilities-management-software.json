In the foreground, a diverse team of three maintenance professionals (one female, two male) are collaborating. They are wearing clean, professional PPE including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility neon vests over work shirts. One technician is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet (viewed from the back, showing a durable black casing, no screen content visible). They are standing near a large, well-maintained industrial pump and motor assembly. The background shows a clean, organized factory environment with soft industrial lighting, highlighting the scale of the facility. The focus is on the professional collaboration and the high-tech industrial setting. Full-body shots of the professionals, showing work boots and cargo work pants. No text or logos visible.",
