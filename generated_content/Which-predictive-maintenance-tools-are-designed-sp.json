  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-resolution hero image inside a modern food and beverage processing plant. The scene shows a reliability engineer (wearing a white food-grade lab coat, hair net, safety glasses, and hearing protection) inspecting a stainless steel conveyor belt system. The engineer is holding a ruggedized tablet (back of device visible) while looking at a wireless vibration sensor mounted on a motor. The environment is gleaming stainless steel, indicating a high level of sanitation. In the background, a blurred figure in full PPE is performing a washdown with a hose, highlighting the wet environment. The lighting is bright, clinical, and cool-toned.
