  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, wide-angle shot inside a modern, clean manufacturing facility with high ceilings and industrial lighting. In the foreground, a yellow quadruped robot (similar to Boston Dynamics Spot) is standing next to a large industrial pump, with a mounted thermal camera payload focused on the pump motor. Slightly behind the robot, a diverse group of two maintenance technicians (one male, one female) wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests are observing the robot. The female technician is holding a ruggedized tablet, looking at a data visualization on the screen (screen content not legible, just glowing graphics). The background shows blurred conveyor belts and automated machinery. The atmosphere is professional, high-tech, and industrial. 8k resolution, cinematic lighting.",
