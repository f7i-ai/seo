In the foreground, a diverse pair of workers: a younger female apprentice (wearing a yellow hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-visibility vest) holding a ruggedized tablet, looking intently at a complex electric motor. Standing slightly behind her is an older male mentor (wearing a white hard hat and similar PPE), pointing at a specific component on the motor, guiding her. The lighting is cool and professional, emphasizing a high-tech \"Industry 4.0\" atmosphere. No text or screens visible. Focus on the interaction and the blend of tools and technology.",
