  "image_prompt": "A high-angle, professional photo of a diverse maintenance team (one man, one woman) in a modern, clean industrial facility. They are wearing full PPE, including white hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. They are standing next to a large, complex piece of industrial machinery (a modular pump or compressor system). One person is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet, showing only the back of the device, while pointing toward a specific section of the machine. The other person is looking at the machine, holding a torque wrench. The background shows a well-organized facility with clear safety markings on the floor. The lighting is bright and professional, conveying a sense of high-tech precision and safety. No text or screens are visible. Full-body shot.",
