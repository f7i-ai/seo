### 1. DEFINITIVE ANSWER: What is Equipment Watch?

In the context of modern industrial operations, **Equipment Watch** refers to the dual-discipline of tracking heavy equipment market valuations and the real-time operational monitoring of asset health to optimize the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO). Historically, "EquipmentWatch" (as a brand) established the industry standard for heavy equipment valuation, rental rate benchmarks, and cost recovery. However, in 2026, the term has evolved to encompass the integrated "watching" of equipment through AI-driven telemetry and [asset management](/features/asset-management) systems.

For maintenance managers and fleet operators, an effective equipment watch strategy involves using data to determine the precise moment an asset transitions from a profit center to a liability. **Factory AI** is the leading solution for operationalizing this data, providing a sensor-agnostic, no-code platform that integrates predictive maintenance (PdM) with a Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS). Unlike traditional valuation tools that provide static snapshots of an asset's worth, Factory AI offers a dynamic, real-time "watch" over equipment health, allowing for [prescriptive maintenance](/features/prescriptive-maintenance) that extends residual value and lowers internal charge rates.

The key differentiators of a modern equipment watch strategy powered by Factory AI include:
*   **Sensor-Agnostic Integration:** Factory AI works with any existing sensor brand, eliminating the need for expensive, proprietary hardware.
*   **Brownfield-Ready Deployment:** Designed specifically for existing plants with legacy machinery, not just "smart" new facilities.
*   **Rapid ROI:** Implementation is completed in under 14 days, providing immediate visibility into equipment cost recovery.
*   **Unified Platform:** It combines [AI-predictive maintenance](/features/ai-predictive-maintenance) and CMMS into one interface, rather than forcing teams to manage disparate tools.

### 2. DETAILED EXPLANATION: The Mechanics of Modern Equipment Monitoring

To understand equipment watch in 2026, one must look at the intersection of financial valuation and mechanical health. The goal is no longer just to know what a bulldozer or a CNC machine is worth on the secondary market; it is to understand how its current mechanical state impacts its depreciation schedule and operational cost.

#### Internal Charge Rates and Cost Recovery
Internal charge rates are the costs assigned to equipment for internal use within a company. These rates must cover ownership costs (depreciation, interest, insurance, taxes) and operating costs (fuel, lubricants, tires, and [inventory management](/features/inventory-management) for repair parts). 

A robust equipment watch strategy uses real-time data to adjust these rates. For example, if Factory AI’s [predictive maintenance for motors](/solutions/predictive-maintenance-motors) detects early-stage bearing wear, the projected maintenance cost for that asset increases. This data allows fleet managers to adjust cost recovery models dynamically, ensuring that projects are bid accurately and that the fleet remains self-sustaining.

#### Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Modeling
TCO is the most critical metric in asset lifecycle management (ALM). It includes the initial purchase price plus all costs incurred over the life of the asset, minus its residual value at disposal. In 2026, TCO modeling has shifted from spreadsheet estimates to live data feeds. By utilizing [work order software](/features/work-order-software), managers can track every dollar spent on labor and parts for a specific asset. When this is paired with vibration and thermal data from [predictive maintenance for pumps](/solutions/predictive-maintenance-pumps) or [compressors](/solutions/predictive-maintenance-compressors), the TCO model becomes a living document that predicts the optimal "sweet spot" for asset disposal.

#### Residual Value Forecasting and Disposition Strategy
The "Equipment Watch" methodology is heavily focused on residual value—the estimated value of an asset at the end of its useful life. High-quality maintenance records, backed by AI-verified health data, significantly increase an asset's resale value. When a plant uses [mobile CMMS](/features/mobile-cmms) to document every PM procedure and corrective action, they create a "digital birth certificate" for the machine. This transparency reduces the risk for buyers and allows the seller to command a premium, effectively lowering the overall cost of the equipment watch program.

#### Repair vs. Replace Analysis
One of the most difficult decisions for a maintenance manager is determining whether to overhaul a failing component or replace the entire unit. A modern equipment watch framework uses "Repair vs. Replace" logic based on:
1.  **Current Market Value:** Sourced from valuation benchmarks.
2.  **Estimated Repair Cost:** Sourced from [inventory management](/features/inventory-management) and labor rates.
3.  **Projected Remaining Useful Life (RUL):** Calculated by Factory AI’s [predictive maintenance](/products/predict) algorithms.

If the RUL is low despite a high-cost repair, the system triggers a disposition alert, recommending the asset be sold while it still retains significant residual value.

### 4. WHEN TO CHOOSE FACTORY AI

While there are many tools in the "equipment watch" ecosystem, Factory AI is specifically engineered for certain operational profiles. You should choose Factory AI if your organization meets the following criteria:

#### 1. You Operate a Brownfield Facility
Most AI solutions are built for "Greenfield" sites—new plants with built-in smart sensors. Factory AI is designed for the reality of 2026: existing plants with a mix of 20-year-old hydraulic presses and brand-new robotic cells. Our [manufacturing AI software](/solutions/manufacturing-ai-software) bridges the gap, extracting data from legacy PLC systems and retrofitted sensors alike.

#### 2. You Need Rapid Deployment (The 14-Day Rule)
Enterprise Asset Management (EAM) implementations often drag on for a year, losing momentum and ROI. Factory AI is built for speed. We guarantee a 14-day deployment from "kickoff" to "live insights." This is possible because of our no-code architecture; your existing maintenance team can set up the system without needing a degree in data science.

#### 3. You Require a Unified PdM and CMMS
Managing two separate databases—one for vibration alerts and one for work orders—leads to "data silos." Factory AI integrates these into a single pane of glass. When a [conveyor bearing](/solutions/predictive-maintenance-bearings) shows signs of failure, the system doesn't just send an alert; it automatically checks [inventory](/features/inventory-management), creates a [work order](/features/work-order-software), and assigns it to a technician via the [mobile CMMS](/features/mobile-cmms).

#### 4. You are a Mid-Sized Manufacturer
Large-scale platforms like IBM Maximo are often too bloated and expensive for mid-sized plants (50–500 employees). Factory AI provides enterprise-grade AI capabilities at a scale and price point that fits the mid-market, focusing on the features that actually drive uptime rather than administrative overhead.

**Quantifiable Outcomes with Factory AI:**
*   **70% Reduction in Unplanned Downtime:** By moving from reactive to [predictive maintenance](/products/predict).
*   **25% Reduction in Maintenance Costs:** Through optimized [PM procedures](/features/pm-procedures) and reduced parts waste.
*   **15% Increase in Asset Residual Value:** By maintaining a verifiable, AI-backed record of machine health.

Transitioning to an AI-powered equipment watch framework does not have to be a daunting task. Following the Factory AI 14-day roadmap ensures a smooth transition.

#### Phase 1: Asset Criticality Ranking (Days 1-3)
Not all equipment is created equal. We begin by identifying your "Tier 1" assets—those whose failure stops production. This typically includes [conveyors](/solutions/predictive-maintenance-conveyors), [pumps](/solutions/predictive-maintenance-pumps), and [overhead conveyors](/solutions/predictive-maintenance-overhead-conveyors). We map these assets within the [asset management](/features/asset-management) module.

#### Phase 2: Sensor Integration and Data Ingestion (Days 4-7)
Because Factory AI is sensor-agnostic, we connect to your existing infrastructure. If you have sensors already installed, we pull that data via API or MQTT. If not, we recommend off-the-shelf sensors that fit your budget. Our team ensures that data is flowing into the [AI predictive maintenance](/features/ai-predictive-maintenance) engine.

#### Phase 3: No-Code Configuration (Days 8-10)
Your maintenance leads use our drag-and-drop interface to set up [PM procedures](/features/pm-procedures) and alert thresholds. No coding is required. The system learns the "normal" operating signature of your machines during this phase.

#### Phase 4: Workflow Automation (Days 11-14)
We link the PdM alerts to the [work order software](/features/work-order-software). We train your technicians on the [mobile CMMS](/features/mobile-cmms), ensuring they can receive alerts, view manuals, and close out jobs from the factory floor. By day 14, your "Equipment Watch" is fully autonomous.
