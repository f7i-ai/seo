  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, professional image set in a clean, modern manufacturing facility. A diverse team of three people—a middle-aged male maintenance manager of Caucasian descent in a hard hat, a young female data analyst of East Asian descent, and a male technician of African descent in safety glasses—are gathered around a ruggedized tablet. The tablet screen displays an intuitive dashboard with AI-powered predictive maintenance charts and asset health scores. The background shows well-maintained industrial equipment like motors and conveyor systems, slightly out of focus. The lighting is bright and professional. No text or logos are visible on screen or anywhere in the image. The overall mood is collaborative and forward-thinking.",
