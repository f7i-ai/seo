In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers (wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-vis vests) are inspecting a large industrial electric motor. One engineer is holding a tablet (back of device visible only) while pointing at a small, ruggedized orange wireless sensor mounted on the motor cooling fins. In the background, automated conveyor lines and robotic arms are blurred but visible, emphasizing a high-tech production environment. Lighting is dramatic, with cool blue tones from the factory lights and warm highlights on the personnel. No text or overlays.",
