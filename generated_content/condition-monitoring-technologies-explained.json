  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern, clean manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers (men and women) wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests are gathered around a large industrial pump. One engineer is holding a tablet (back of device visible only) pointing it at the machine, while another uses a handheld thermal camera. In the background, automated conveyor belts and digital dashboards displaying green graphs and data visualizations are visible, symbolizing the integration of IIoT. The lighting is professional, with a mix of cool industrial blue and warm accent lights. No text or words in the image.",
