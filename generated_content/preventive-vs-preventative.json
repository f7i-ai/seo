  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a clean, modern manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance engineers (men and women) wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests are gathered around a large industrial pump. One engineer is pointing at a specific component of the machine, while another holds a tablet (showing only the back of the device) to reference data. The background is slightly blurred but shows high-tech automated machinery and conveyor belts. The lighting is professional and cool-toned, emphasizing a high-tech, \"Industry 4.0\" atmosphere. No text or words should be visible in the image.",
