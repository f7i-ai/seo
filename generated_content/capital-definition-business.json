  "image_prompt": "A high-angle, wide-shot photograph of a clean, modern mid-sized manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of three professionals—a female plant manager in a white hard hat and high-visibility vest, and two male technicians in blue coveralls and safety glasses—are standing near a large, complex industrial motor and pump assembly. They are looking at the machine, appearing to discuss its condition. One technician is holding a ruggedized tablet, but only the back of the device is visible to the camera. The background shows a well-lit production line with conveyors and robotic arms. The lighting is bright and professional, emphasizing a high-tech but \"real-world\" industrial atmosphere. All personnel are wearing full appropriate PPE, including hard hats, safety glasses, and steel-toed boots. No screens or text are visible.",
