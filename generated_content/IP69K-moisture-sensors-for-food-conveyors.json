  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-quality hero image inside a modern, sterile food processing facility. The scene focuses on a stainless steel conveyor belt carrying baked goods (like biscuits or crackers). In the foreground, a sleek, cylindrical stainless steel sensor (IP69K style) is mounted on a hygienic bracket above the belt, emitting a faint, invisible beam (implied focus). In the background, a reliability engineer wearing a white lab coat, hair net, safety glasses, and high-visibility vest is inspecting a tablet (back of device visible only). The environment is gleaming, wet (suggesting recent washdown), and industrial. Lighting is bright, cool, and clinical. No text overlays.",
