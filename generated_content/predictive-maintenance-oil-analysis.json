  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern, clean manufacturing facility or power plant. In the foreground, a diverse team of two maintenance engineers (one male, one female) wearing full PPE including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests are inspecting a large industrial hydraulic pump. The female engineer is holding a generic industrial tablet (back facing the camera) while pointing at a digital sensor mounted on the machine's oil reservoir. The background shows depth with blurred industrial piping, yellow safety railings, and soft, professional lighting. No text or overlays in the image. The atmosphere is professional, high-tech, and efficient.",
