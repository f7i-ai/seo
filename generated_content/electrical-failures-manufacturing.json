  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern, high-tech manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse maintenance team (a man and a woman) wearing full arc-flash PPE (hard hats with face shields lifted, safety glasses, FR clothing) are inspecting a large, open industrial electrical control panel. The woman is holding a professional thermal imaging camera (back of device visible), pointing it at the busbars. The man is holding a tablet displaying a digital schematic. The background shows blurred automated production lines with robotic arms and soft blue/orange industrial lighting. The atmosphere is professional, focused, and highlights advanced technology in maintenance. No text in the image.",
