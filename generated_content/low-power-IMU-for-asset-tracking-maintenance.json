  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern, clean industrial manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a close-up (macro style) of a small, ruggedized industrial IoT sensor mounted securely on the side of a large blue electric motor. The sensor has a small status LED glowing softly green. In the slightly blurred background, a diverse group of maintenance engineers (men and women) wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests are consulting a tablet, looking at data visualizations. The lighting is professional and dramatic, highlighting the sensor as the focal point. No text or words in the image. 16:9 aspect ratio.",
