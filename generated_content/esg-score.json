  "image_prompt": "A professional, photo-realistic wide shot of a modern industrial manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are standing near a large, clean industrial pump system. They are wearing full PPE, including white hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility orange vests. One person is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet (showing only the back of the device), while the others are looking at the equipment and discussing. The background shows a clean, well-lit factory floor with organized piping and high-tech machinery. The lighting is bright and natural, suggesting a sustainable and efficient environment. No text or words are visible on any surfaces. Full body shots of the professionals.",
