  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern Australian manufacturing facility. The scene features a diverse group of maintenance engineers and safety officers (men and women) wearing standard Australian PPE: high-visibility vests (orange/yellow with reflective strips), hard hats, and safety glasses. They are standing near a large, complex industrial machine (like a compressor or conveyor system). One engineer is holding a tablet device, showing the back of the device to the camera (screen not visible), appearing to scan a QR code on the machinery. The lighting is professional and industrial, highlighting the clean, organized nature of the plant. No text or words should be visible in the image. The atmosphere conveys safety, compliance, and technological efficiency.",
