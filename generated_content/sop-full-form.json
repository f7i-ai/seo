  "image_prompt": "A wide-angle, photo-realistic shot of a modern, clean industrial manufacturing floor. In the foreground, a diverse team of three maintenance professionals (one man, two women) are standing near a large, complex piece of machinery (a series of industrial pumps and motors). They are all wearing full PPE, including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility orange vests. One technician is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet, but only the back of the device is visible to the camera. They are gesturing toward a specific section of the machine, appearing to discuss a procedure. The lighting is bright and professional, highlighting the metallic textures of the equipment and the clean, polished concrete floor. No text or logos are visible on the equipment or clothing. All people are shown in full body.",
