In the foreground, a diverse reliability engineer (female, wearing safety glasses, hard hat, and high-vis vest) is inspecting a large industrial electric motor. She is holding a ruggedized tablet in one hand (back of tablet visible), referencing a digital workflow, while pointing to a specific component on the motor with her other hand. In the background, blurred slightly, another technician in full PPE is working on a conveyor system. The lighting is industrial but warm, highlighting the \"digital meets physical\" nature of modern maintenance. No text or screens visible. 8k resolution.",
