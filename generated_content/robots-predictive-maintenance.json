  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern, high-tech automotive manufacturing plant. In the foreground, a diverse team of two reliability engineers (one male, one female) wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests are inspecting a large, orange industrial robotic arm. The female engineer is holding a tablet (back of device visible only) and pointing at a specific joint on the robot. The background is filled with a line of similar robotic arms in soft focus, with sleek, cool-toned LED lighting illuminating the clean facility. No text or overlays in the image. The atmosphere conveys precision, technology, and industrial safety.",
