In the foreground, a reliability engineer (wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, and high-visibility vest) is viewed from behind, holding a ruggedized tablet. The tablet screen is not visible. The engineer is looking up at a complex assembly of industrial piping and large pumps. In the background, slightly out of focus, another technician in blue coveralls and PPE is inspecting a gauge. The lighting is cool and industrial, with shafts of light emphasizing the \"clean\" and organized nature of the facility. No text or overlays. High resolution, 8k.",
