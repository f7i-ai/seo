  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers and maintenance technicians (men and women, various ethnicities) are wearing standard PPE including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. They are gathered around a large industrial pump and motor assembly. One technician is holding a tablet (back of device visible only) as if referencing data. The background shows a clean, busy factory floor with blurred conveyors and automated machinery. The lighting is professional and industrial, with a mix of cool factory lighting and warm highlights on the equipment. No text or overlays in the image. The atmosphere conveys collaboration, technology, and operational excellence.",
