  "image_prompt": "A professional, photo-realistic wide shot of a modern but established (brownfield) manufacturing floor. A diverse group of three maintenance professionals—a woman in her 40s and two men in their 30s—are standing near a large industrial motor and pump assembly. They are all wearing full PPE, including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility orange vests over work clothes. One person is pointing toward a specific part of the machinery while the others look on intently, discussing a reliability strategy. They are shown from the waist up or full body. One person holds a rugged industrial tablet, but only the back of the device is visible to the camera. The lighting is bright and industrial, highlighting the textures of the metal machinery and the clean but used environment of a working plant. No text or screens are visible.",
