In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (one female, two male) are standing near a large, well-maintained centrifugal pump and motor assembly. They are wearing full appropriate PPE, including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility yellow vests over work uniforms. One technician is pointing toward the machinery while another holds a ruggedized tablet (back of the device shown, no screen visible). The background shows a clean, organized brownfield factory environment with overhead conveyors and various piping systems. The lighting is bright and industrial, conveying a sense of efficiency and advanced technology. No text or logos are visible. Full body shots of the professionals are included.",
