  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-resolution image inside a modern industrial gas compression facility. In the foreground, a reliability engineer wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, and high-visibility vest is inspecting a large reciprocating compressor. The engineer is holding a tablet device (back of the tablet visible) and appears to be checking data. In the background, there is a large, multi-cylinder reciprocating compressor painted industrial grey or blue, with complex piping and analog gauges visible. The lighting is professional and industrial, highlighting the clean, technical nature of modern maintenance. No text or overlays in the image.",
