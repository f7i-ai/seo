In the foreground, a diverse team of three professionals—a maintenance manager in a white hard hat and high-visibility vest, a reliability engineer holding a ruggedized tablet (back of the device visible), and a technician in blue coveralls—are standing near a large, clean centrifugal pump and motor assembly. They are looking at the equipment and discussing its condition. The environment is well-lit, clean, and organized, representing a world-class reliability-focused plant. Everyone is wearing appropriate PPE, including safety glasses and steel-toed boots. No text or screens are visible.",
