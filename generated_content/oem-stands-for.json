In the foreground, a diverse group of two maintenance technicians (one male, one female) and a plant manager are standing around a large, complex industrial automated assembly machine. They are wearing full PPE including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. The female technician is holding a tablet (back of device visible only) and pointing at a specific component on the machine, while the others look on intently, discussing a maintenance strategy. The background shows blurred production lines and cool industrial lighting, emphasizing a high-tech, 2026 era atmosphere. No text or overlays in the image.",
