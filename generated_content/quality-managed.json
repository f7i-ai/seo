  "image_prompt": "A wide-angle, photo-realistic shot of a modern 2026 industrial manufacturing floor. In the foreground, a diverse team of three professionals (one woman, two men) are standing near a large, clean robotic assembly arm. They are wearing full professional PPE: white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility vests over industrial work clothes. One person is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet, but we only see the back of the device, which has a matte black protective casing. The background shows a well-lit, organized facility with clear safety markings on the floor and other technicians working in the distance. The atmosphere is professional, focused, and high-tech. No text or logos are visible on any equipment or clothing. Full body shots of the professionals are visible.",
