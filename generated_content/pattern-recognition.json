  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, cinematic shot inside a modern, high-tech manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a reliability engineer (wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-visibility vest) is standing next to a large industrial electric motor. The engineer is holding a ruggedized tablet, but the screen is facing away from the camera. The focus is on the engineer looking intently at the machinery, analyzing it. In the background, slightly blurred, are automated conveyor belts and robotic arms in motion. The lighting is a mix of cool industrial blue LED strips and warm amber safety lights, creating a professional, futuristic atmosphere. No text or overlays in the image.",
