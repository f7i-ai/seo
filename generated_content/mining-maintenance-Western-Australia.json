  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot of a modern open-pit mine site in the Pilbara region of Western Australia during the \"golden hour\" (sunset). The landscape features deep red earth and rugged terrain. In the foreground, a diverse group of three mining maintenance professionals (two men, one woman) are standing near a large yellow haul truck and a conveyor system. They are wearing full PPE: high-visibility orange and yellow shirts with reflective strips, hard hats, safety glasses, and steel-capped boots. One technician is holding a ruggedized tablet, but only the back of the device is visible (no screen content). They are looking toward the fixed plant infrastructure in the middle distance. The lighting is dramatic, highlighting the dust in the air and the scale of the machinery. No text or logos in the image. Professional industrial photography style.",
