  "image_prompt": "A wide-angle, photo-realistic shot of a modern, high-tech manufacturing facility in 2026. In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (two men, one woman) are standing near a large, complex industrial robotic arm and a series of interconnected pumps. They are wearing clean, professional PPE: white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility vests over navy blue work uniforms. One technician is holding a ruggedized tablet, showing only the back of the device to the camera. They are engaged in a collaborative discussion, pointing toward a specific section of the machinery. The background is brightly lit with LED industrial lighting, showing a clean, organized floor with yellow safety lines and other advanced machinery slightly out of focus. No text or logos are visible. The atmosphere is one of professional expertise and technological integration.",
