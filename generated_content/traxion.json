All personnel are wearing professional PPE, including branded navy blue work shirts, hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. In the background, other technicians are visible near a large stationary generator and a fleet truck. One technician is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet (showing only the back of the device). The lighting is bright and professional, highlighting the clean, organized shop floor. No text or logos are visible on the equipment or walls.
