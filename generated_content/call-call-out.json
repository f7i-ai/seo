  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern industrial manufacturing facility at night. The lighting is moody, with cool blue ambient light from machinery and warm task lighting. In the foreground, a diverse maintenance technician (wearing a hard hat, safety glasses, and reflective vest) is looking at a tablet device held in their hand (screen not visible to camera). In the background, out of focus, large automated machinery or conveyor belts are visible. The atmosphere conveys urgency but control—professionalism in a high-tech environment. No text or words in the image. 8k resolution.",
