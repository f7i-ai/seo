  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, photo-realistic professional photograph of a modern industrial manufacturing floor. In the foreground, a diverse team of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are collaborating. They are wearing clean, professional PPE: white hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility yellow vests. One person is holding a rugged industrial tablet (showing only the back of the device), while the others are looking at a large, well-maintained industrial motor assembly. The background shows a clean, organized \"brownfield\" factory setting with a mix of legacy and modern machinery, clearly marked safety walkways, and bright, natural industrial lighting. No text or logos are visible. Full-body shots of the workers to show the scale of the environment.",
