In the foreground, a diverse team of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are standing near a large industrial pump system. They are wearing clean, professional PPE: white hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests over navy work uniforms. One technician is pointing toward a specific component of the machinery while another holds a ruggedized industrial tablet (viewed from the back, showing a carbon-fiber protective casing, no screen visible). The background shows a clean, well-lit factory floor with automated guided vehicles (AGVs) moving in the distance and organized workstations. The lighting is bright and natural, emphasizing a safe and efficient work environment. No text or logos are visible.",
