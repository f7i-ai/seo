To depreciate is to systematically allocate the cost of a tangible industrial asset over its estimated useful life, reflecting its gradual decline in value due to wear, tear, age, or obsolescence. In manufacturing and facility operations, depreciation serves as a non-cash accounting method that matches the expense of a machine to the revenue it generates over time.

### Why Depreciation Matters in Maintenance
For maintenance managers and plant operators in 2026, depreciation is more than just an accounting line item; it is a critical metric for asset lifecycle management. While the finance department uses depreciation to manage tax liabilities and balance sheets, the maintenance department views it as a gauge for the "repair vs. replace" threshold. As an asset’s book value decreases through depreciation, the cost of keeping it operational often increases. When the annual maintenance cost exceeds the depreciated value or the potential productivity of a new asset, it signals a need for capital expenditure (CAPEX) planning.

### Key Methods and Terms
Industrial organizations typically use specific frameworks to calculate how assets lose value:

*   **Straight-Line Depreciation:** The simplest method, where the value of the equipment is reduced by an equal amount every year until it reaches its salvage value.
*   **MACRS (Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System):** The standard tax depreciation system in the United States, which allows for faster depreciation in the early years of an asset's life. You can find detailed recovery period tables via the [IRS Publication 946](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p946).
*   **Salvage Value (Residual Value):** The estimated resale value of an asset at the end of its useful life.
*   **Book Value:** The original cost of the asset minus its accumulated depreciation. This is often contrasted with **Market Value**, which is what the equipment could actually be sold for on the open market.

### The Maintenance-First Perspective
Effective maintenance strategies can influence the economic reality of depreciation. While accounting schedules are often fixed, proactive care can extend the "useful life" of a machine far beyond its theoretical paper limit. By utilizing [equipment maintenance software](/products/equipment-maintenance-software), facilities can track real-time health data to ensure that an asset remains productive even after it has been fully depreciated on the balance sheet. This creates a "value gap" where the company benefits from a high-performing asset that no longer carries a heavy depreciation expense, directly improving the bottom line.

Conversely, poor maintenance can lead to "accelerated physical depreciation," where a machine fails before its financial life cycle is complete. This forced early replacement can disrupt CAPEX budgets and lead to unplanned downtime. Integrating depreciation data with [asset management](/features/asset-management) tools allows decision-makers to align financial reality with physical performance.
