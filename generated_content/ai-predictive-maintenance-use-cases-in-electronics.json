  "image_prompt": "A high-quality, photorealistic image set in a brightly lit, modern electronics manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a female maintenance engineer of East Asian descent and a male operations manager of African descent are looking at a tablet. The tablet screen displays complex data visualizations, including vibration waveform graphs and a thermal map of a machine. Both are wearing light blue cleanroom suits and safety glasses. In the background, slightly out of focus, is a pristine SMT production line with a pick-and-place machine actively working. The overall mood is professional, high-tech, and collaborative.",
