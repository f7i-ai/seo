In the foreground, a maintenance manager (wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-visibility vest) is holding a tablet (back of tablet visible) and looking up at a high-tech automated storage and retrieval system. In the background, blurred slightly, are rows of organized shelving with color-coded bins and a forklift operator moving a pallet. The lighting is bright and industrial cool-white, highlighting the organization and technology. No text or words should be visible in the image.",
