  "image_prompt": "A high-end, photo-realistic wide shot of a modern, clean industrial manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of three professionals—a female maintenance manager in a white hard hat and high-visibility vest, and two male technicians in blue uniforms and safety glasses—are standing near a large, well-maintained industrial compressor. They are engaged in a professional discussion. One technician is holding an industrial tablet, but we only see the rugged back of the device, not the screen.
