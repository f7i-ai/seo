  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, cinematic shot inside a modern industrial refrigeration engine room. In the foreground, a reliability engineer wearing a hard hat, safety glasses, and high-visibility vest is inspecting a large industrial screw compressor (painted blue or grey). They are holding a tablet (screen not visible) and looking at a wireless sensor mounted on the compressor housing. In the background, rows of insulated piping (some with orange ammonia labels) and other compressors fade into a clean, well-lit depth of field. The lighting is cool and industrial, emphasizing technology and safety. No text in the image.",
