  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern, clean manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse team of two maintenance technicians (one male, one female) wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests are consulting a tablet device. The back of the tablet is visible, not the screen. They are standing in front of a large, complex industrial machine (like a conveyor system or automated assembly line) that is currently stationary. In the background, blurred slightly, a plant manager is observing. The lighting is professional, highlighting the \"Golden Hour\" concept with warm, focused lighting on the technicians and the machine, contrasting with the cooler industrial background. The image conveys focus, technology, and efficiency. No text or overlays.",
