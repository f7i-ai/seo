A diverse team of reliability engineers in clean PPE are looking at large, transparent holographic displays showing 3D digital twins of a manufacturing line. The screens show real-time heat maps and predictive maintenance triggers. In the background, a clean, well-lit factory floor is visible through a glass partition, with robotic arms and conveyors operating smoothly. The atmosphere is calm and data-driven, not chaotic.",
