  "image_prompt": "Photorealistic, ultra-high-resolution image of a modern manufacturing floor in a near-future setting. Wide-angle view of a spacious, clean factory with advanced robotic arms, autonomous mobile robots, and modular workcells. In the foreground, a diverse group of engineers and operators (different genders, ethnicities, and ages) stand around a transparent holographic display showing a 3D digital twin of the factory with animated flows and robot paths. Some people interact with the holographic interface using gestures and tablets. Large industrial robots are working safely alongside humans in the background, with visible safety scanners and light curtains. Overhead, semi-transparent AR-style overlays show data streams, performance metrics, and simulation timelines, but with no readable text or logos. Lighting is bright and realistic, with reflections on metal surfaces and glass. The overall mood is professional, collaborative, and technologically advanced, emphasizing the integration of AI-driven simulation and real-world production.",
