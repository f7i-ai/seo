In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers (men and women) wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests are examining a large industrial electric motor. One engineer is pointing at a small, wireless vibration sensor attached to the motor housing. In the background, blurred automated conveyor lines are running. The lighting is cool industrial blue with warm highlights on the people. No text or digital overlays. The focus is on the interaction between the humans and the physical machinery.
