  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot of a modern oil and gas refinery at twilight. In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance engineers (one female, two male) are wearing full PPE including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility coveralls. They are looking at a large industrial compressor. One engineer is holding a ruggedized tablet, but the screen is not visible to the camera; they are pointing at a specific section of the machinery, discussing a maintenance strategy. The background shows the complex infrastructure of pipes, distillation columns, and safety lighting typical of a refinery. The lighting is dramatic, with a mix of natural sunset and industrial amber safety lights. No text or overlays. High resolution, 8k.",
