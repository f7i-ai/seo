  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot of a modern manufacturing facility interior. In the foreground, a diverse team of reliability engineers (men and women) wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests are inspecting a large industrial motor. One engineer is holding a tablet (back facing camera) while pointing at a sensor on the machine. The background shows a clean, high-tech production line with conveyors and automated machinery. The lighting is professional and cool-toned, emphasizing a futuristic, \"Industry 4.0\" atmosphere. No text or overlays in the image. Focus on the interaction between the human workers and the machinery.",
