In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance professionals (men and women) are wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One engineer is holding a tablet (back of device visible only) while looking at a large industrial motor. In the background, automated conveyors and storage racks filled with spare parts are visible, symbolizing the connection between machinery and supply chain. The lighting is professional industrial lighting, with a slight blue hue to suggest technology integration. No text or overlays in the image.",
