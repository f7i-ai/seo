  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern industrial coal preparation plant (wash plant). The lighting is dramatic but professional, highlighting the scale of the machinery. In the foreground, a diverse group of three engineers (two men, one woman) are wearing full PPE: hard hats, high-visibility orange and yellow vests, safety glasses, and steel-toed boots. They are standing on a metal grating walkway looking up at a massive vibrating screen and cyclone cluster. One engineer is holding a ruggedized tablet, but the screen of the tablet is NOT visible (we see the back of the device). The machinery looks used but well-maintained, with visible pipes, steel beams, and conveyor belts in the background. No text or words in the image. Atmosphere conveys high-tech industrial efficiency.",
