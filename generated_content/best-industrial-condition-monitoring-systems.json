  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot of a modern manufacturing facility interior. In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers (men and women) wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests are collaborating. One engineer is pointing toward a large industrial motor, while another holds a tablet (back of tablet visible only) as if checking data. The background shows a clean, high-tech production line with blurred motion of machinery. The lighting is professional and industrial, with a mix of cool blue factory lighting and warm highlights on the machinery. No text or overlays in the image. 8k resolution, highly detailed.",
