  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, photo-realistic hero image of a modern manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse pair of maintenance professionals (one man, one woman) are collaborating. They are wearing clean, professional PPE, including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility yellow vests. One professional is holding a rugged industrial tablet, showing only the back of the device to the camera. They are standing next to a large, well-maintained industrial motor that has a prominent 2D Data Matrix (UID) metal tag riveted to its side. The background shows a clean, organized \"brownfield\" factory floor with various pipes and machinery, softly blurred to keep focus on the professionals and the asset. The lighting is bright and natural, conveying a sense of efficiency and advanced technology. No text or words are visible in the image. Full-body or three-quarter view.",
