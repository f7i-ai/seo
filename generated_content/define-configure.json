  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, professional photograph of a diverse group of maintenance professionals (one man, one woman) in a modern, clean industrial manufacturing setting. Both individuals are wearing full PPE, including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility yellow vests. The woman is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet, showing only the back of the device to the camera. They are standing in front of a large, well-maintained industrial pump and motor assembly. The lighting is bright and natural, highlighting the metallic textures of the machinery. The shot is a medium-full body shot, showing the professionals engaged in a collaborative discussion about the equipment. No text or logos are visible. The background shows a clean, organized factory floor with other machinery slightly out of focus.",
