  "image_prompt": "A professional, photo-realistic hero image of a modern manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are collaborating. They are wearing clean, high-visibility vests, hard hats, and safety glasses. One technician is pointing toward a large, well-maintained industrial motor assembly, while another holds a ruggedized industrial tablet (showing only the back of the device). The environment is brightly lit, clean, and represents a high-tech \"brownfield\" plant with a mix of heavy machinery and digital integration. The focus is on the teamwork and the reliability of the equipment. No text or words are visible in the image. Full body shots of the professionals are shown.",
