  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern, high-tech manufacturing facility in the year 2026. In the foreground, a reliability engineer (wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-vis vest) is looking at a ruggedized tablet (back of tablet visible only) while standing next to a large industrial electric motor. The motor has a sleek, glowing edge-computing sensor attached to it. In the background, blurred slightly, are other diverse technicians working on automated conveyor lines. The lighting is a mix of cool industrial blue LEDs and warm amber safety lights. The atmosphere conveys a sense of advanced technology seamlessly integrated with heavy machinery.
