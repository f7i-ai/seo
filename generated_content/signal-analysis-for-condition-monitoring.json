  "image_prompt": "A close-up, photorealistic shot inside a modern industrial facility. Focus on a reliability engineer's hand holding a high-end vibration analyzer stylus against the bearing housing of a large, blue electric motor. In the background, slightly out of focus, is a complex array of piping and industrial machinery. The lighting is dramatic, highlighting the texture of the metal and the digital waveform display on the analyzer screen (which shows a spectral graph, not text). The engineer is wearing a safety glove and a high-visibility sleeve. The image conveys precision, technology, and industrial grit. No text overlays.",
