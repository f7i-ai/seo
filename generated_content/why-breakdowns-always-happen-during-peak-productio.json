One section of the conveyor is stopped, and two maintenance technicians in high-visibility vests and hard hats are using a handheld thermal imaging camera and a tablet to inspect a glowing red motor housing. The background shows the rest of the factory blurred, suggesting high-speed activity, while the foreground focuses on the technical diagnostic process. No text, 2026-era modern industrial aesthetic.",
