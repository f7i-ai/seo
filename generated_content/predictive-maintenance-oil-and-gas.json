In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers and technicians (men and women) are wearing full PPE (hard hats, safety glasses, high-vis coveralls). One engineer is looking at a ruggedized tablet (back of device visible) while pointing toward a complex array of pipes and a large centrifugal pump. The background shows the intricate steel structures and lighting of the facility. The atmosphere is professional, high-tech, and industrial. No text or overlays.",
