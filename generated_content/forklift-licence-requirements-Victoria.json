  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-quality hero image inside a modern, clean warehouse in Victoria, Australia. The scene shows a diverse group of warehouse workers and a maintenance manager. In the foreground, a female worker wearing a hard hat, high-visibility vest, and safety glasses is conducting a pre-start check on a yellow forklift. She is holding a rugged tablet (back of device visible) appearing to use an app. In the background, a male manager is pointing at a digital dashboard on a wall-mounted screen showing green \"health status\" icons for the fleet. The lighting is bright and industrial. No text or logos should be visible on the clothing or machines. The atmosphere conveys safety, technology, and efficiency.",
