A diverse team of three maintenance professionals—a white male, a black female, and an asian male—are gathered around a large, stationary industrial drivetrain consisting of an electric motor and a gearbox. All are wearing proper PPE, including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. The black female technician is pointing to a complex coupling between the motor and gearbox.
