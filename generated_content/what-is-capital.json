In the foreground, a diverse group of three industrial professionals (a maintenance manager in a white hard hat, a finance officer in a blazer holding a tablet, and a technician in high-vis gear) are standing around a large, complex automated assembly machine. They are engaged in a serious but collaborative discussion, pointing at a specific component of the machinery.
