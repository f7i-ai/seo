  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a maintenance manager (wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-vis vest) is looking at a tablet held in their left hand (screen not visible to camera). They are pointing with their right hand toward a large, complex industrial conveyor system in the background. In the background, two technicians (diverse gender/ethnicity, wearing blue hard hats and ear protection) are inspecting a motor on the line. The lighting is industrial but warm, highlighting the clean, organized nature of the facility. Depth of field focuses on the manager, slightly blurring the background assets. No text or overlays.",
