  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot of a modern industrial manufacturing facility during the early morning \"first watch\" shift. The lighting is a mix of cool blue morning light streaming through high windows and warm industrial amber safety lighting. In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance technicians (men and women) are conducting a shift handover meeting. They are wearing full PPE including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One technician is holding a tablet (back facing the camera) showing a complex data dashboard, pointing toward a large industrial conveyor system in the background. The facility looks clean and high-tech, representing a \"brownfield\" plant that has been modernized. No text or words should be visible in the image.",
