A diverse team of three people is collaborating around a large, complex piece of industrial machinery with a robotic arm. A female maintenance manager of Hispanic descent with a hard hat and safety glasses is holding a tablet displaying colorful graphs and work order data. A male technician of African descent, also in a hard hat and high-visibility vest, is pointing to a specific component on the machine. A third engineer, a Caucasian woman with her hair tied back in a net, looks on, holding a clipboard. The atmosphere is collaborative, high-tech, and positive.
