  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern, clean manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance professionals (a man and a woman) wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests are looking at a tablet held by one of them (back of tablet visible only). They are standing in front of a large, complex industrial machine with pipes and motors. A subtle, holographic-style digital overlay (blue wireframe) surrounds a specific motor on the machine, symbolizing digital twin or predictive analysis, but it should look integrated and professional, not cartoonish. The lighting is industrial but warm, highlighting the collaboration between the humans and the technology. No text or words in the image. 8k resolution.",
