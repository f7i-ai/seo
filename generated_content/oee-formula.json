  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, professional photograph of a diverse group of three manufacturing professionals—a woman in a white hard hat and two men in yellow high-visibility vests—standing on a clean, modern factory floor. They are gathered near a large, complex industrial machine (a CNC mill or a high-speed bottling line). One person is holding a rugged industrial tablet, but only the back of the device is visible to the camera. They are all wearing appropriate PPE, including safety glasses and ear protection. The lighting is bright and industrial, highlighting the metallic textures of the machinery. The shot is a full-body or medium-wide shot, capturing the scale of the manufacturing environment. No text or screens are visible.\n\n---\n\n### EXTERNAL REFERENCES\n*   [Lean Enterprise Institute: Understanding OEE](https://www.lean.org)\n*   [ISO 22400: Key Performance Indicators for Manufacturing Operations Management](https://www.iso.org)\n*   [The Six Big Losses of OEE](https://www.oee.com)",
