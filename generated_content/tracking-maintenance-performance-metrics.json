  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern, clean manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance professionals (a mix of men and women, different ethnicities) are wearing safety gear (hard hats, safety glasses, high-vis vests). One engineer is holding a tablet, showing the back of the device, pointing toward a large industrial motor. In the background, blurred slightly, are automated conveyor belts and robotic arms. The lighting is cool industrial blue with warm highlights on the machinery. No text or overlays in the image. The atmosphere conveys professionalism, technology, and collaboration.",
