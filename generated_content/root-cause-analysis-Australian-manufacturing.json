  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern Australian manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance engineers (men and women) are wearing high-visibility vests, hard hats, and safety glasses. They are gathered around a large industrial pump and motor assembly. One engineer is pointing at a specific component of the motor, while another holds a tablet (back of tablet visible only) as if referencing data. The background shows a busy, clean factory floor with conveyor belts and automated machinery. The lighting is professional and industrial, highlighting the safety gear and the machinery. No text or overlays in the image. Atmosphere conveys professionalism, safety, and advanced technology.",
