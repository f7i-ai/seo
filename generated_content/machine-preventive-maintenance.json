  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, professional image for a manufacturing blog post. In a clean, well-lit, modern factory, a female maintenance manager of Hispanic descent and a younger male technician of Asian descent stand side-by-side looking at a tablet. The tablet screen shows a dashboard with equipment health graphs and a 3D model of a machine. They are standing next to a large, complex piece of industrial machinery. Both are wearing safety glasses and clean, dark blue polo shirts with a small, generic company logo. The focus is on their collaborative, data-driven interaction. The background is slightly blurred to emphasize the people and the technology. No text on the image.",
