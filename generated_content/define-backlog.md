A maintenance backlog is the total volume of approved maintenance work that has been identified but not yet completed. It represents the cumulative time required to clear all pending tasks—including preventive maintenance, corrective repairs, and deferred work—using the current available labor resources.

### The Strategic "Health Check"
In the context of modern industrial reliability, a backlog is not merely a "to-do list" or a sign of failure; it is a vital health check for the facility. A well-managed backlog indicates that a maintenance team is effectively identifying necessary work before it results in catastrophic asset failure. Conversely, a backlog that is too small (less than two weeks) often suggests overstaffing or a failure to identify hidden defects, while a backlog that is too large (exceeding six weeks) indicates a high risk of "run-to-failure" events and potential safety hazards.

According to [SMRP Best Practices](https://smrp.org), the ideal maintenance backlog typically sits between two to four weeks for a standard industrial shift. This range provides enough work to keep the team productive and allows for efficient scheduling without leaving the organization vulnerable to the risks of deferred maintenance.

### Measuring Backlog in Weeks
The industry standard for measuring a backlog is "Backlog Weeks." This is calculated by taking the total estimated man-hours of all work orders in the backlog and dividing it by the total available weekly labor capacity. This metric is essential for resource capacity planning, as it allows managers to determine if they need to hire more technicians, utilize contractors, or invest in better [asset management](/features/asset-management) tools to streamline workflows.

### Backlog vs. Deferred Maintenance
It is critical to distinguish between a healthy backlog and deferred maintenance. A backlog consists of all work that is planned and ready to be scheduled. Deferred maintenance refers to the practice of pushing back necessary repairs or inspections due to a lack of budget, parts, or labor. While all deferred maintenance is part of the backlog, not all backlogged items are deferred; many are simply waiting for the next scheduled maintenance window according to established [PM procedures](/features/pm-procedures).

### Managing the Lifecycle
Effective backlog management requires a clear understanding of the work order management lifecycle. This begins with asset criticality ranking, ensuring that the most vital equipment receives priority in the queue. By utilizing [work order software](/features/work-order-software), maintenance managers can categorize tasks by urgency, ensuring that corrective maintenance (CM) on critical assets is addressed before low-priority cosmetic repairs.
