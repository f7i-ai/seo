In the foreground, a diverse team of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are collaborating. They are wearing clean, professional PPE including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility yellow vests over work shirts. One technician is pointing toward a large, well-maintained industrial motor assembly, while another holds a ruggedized industrial tablet (shown from the back, no screen visible). The third technician is inspecting a sensor attached to a pipe. The background shows a clean, brightly lit factory with various machinery and overhead conveyors.
