  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, photo-realistic wide shot of a modern, brightly lit industrial warehouse and maintenance hub in 2026. In the foreground, a diverse team of three professionals—a female maintenance planner in a white hard hat and high-visibility vest, and two male technicians in blue coveralls and safety glasses—are standing near a neatly organized pallet of industrial components. One technician is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet (showing only the back of the device). They are looking at a large, wall-mounted digital display (the display itself is out of focus or showing blurred data charts). The background shows clean, high-reaching storage racks and a glimpse of an automated guided vehicle (AGV) moving through an aisle. The atmosphere is professional, efficient, and technologically advanced. All personnel are wearing full PPE including hard hats, gloves clipped to belts, and steel-toed boots.
