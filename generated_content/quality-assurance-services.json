  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, photo-realistic hero image of a modern industrial manufacturing floor. In the foreground, a diverse group of three professionals—a maintenance manager, a quality engineer, and a plant director—are standing near a large, well-maintained industrial compressor. They are all wearing appropriate PPE, including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility yellow vests. One person is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet, but only the back of the device is visible to the camera. The background shows a clean, organized \"brownfield\" factory setting with a mix of legacy and modern machinery, overhead conveyors, and clear safety floor markings. The lighting is bright and professional, conveying a sense of efficiency, reliability, and technological advancement. Full-body shots of the people, no text or words visible in the image.",
