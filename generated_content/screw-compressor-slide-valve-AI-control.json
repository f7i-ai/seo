  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a clean, modern industrial compressor room. In the foreground, a reliability engineer (wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-vis vest) is standing next to a large, industrial rotary screw compressor (painted industrial blue or green). The engineer is holding a tablet (back of tablet visible) and looking at a holographic-style data overlay appearing near the compressor's control panel, showing a smooth graph curve labeled \"Slide Valve Position\" and \"Predicted Demand.\" The background shows piping, pressure gauges, and other industrial equipment, slightly blurred to focus on the engineer and the machine. Lighting is cool industrial blue with warm highlights on the machinery. No text on the image itself. 8k resolution.",
