In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are collaborating near a large, clean robotic assembly arm. They are wearing full professional PPE: white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility yellow vests over navy blue work uniforms. One person is pointing toward a specific joint on the machinery, while another holds a ruggedized industrial tablet (showing only the back of the device). The environment is clean, organized, and reflects a high-tech \"Industry 4.0\" atmosphere. No text or logos are visible. The lighting is natural and bright, highlighting the metallic textures of the equipment and the professional demeanor of the team. Full body shots, showing safety boots and the scale of the industrial environment.",
