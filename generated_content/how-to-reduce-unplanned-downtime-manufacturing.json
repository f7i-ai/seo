In the foreground, a diverse team of two maintenance engineers in clean PPE (hard hats, safety vests, and glasses) are looking at a ruggedized tablet showing a real-time machine health dashboard with green and yellow status indicators. In the background, a complex automated packaging line is visible, with subtle IIoT sensors attached to the motor housings. The lighting is bright and industrial, emphasizing a clean, high-tech, and proactive maintenance environment. No text in the image.",
