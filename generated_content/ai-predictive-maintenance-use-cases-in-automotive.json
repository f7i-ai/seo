  "image_prompt": "A high-quality, photorealistic image set in a bright, modern automotive manufacturing plant. In the foreground, a female maintenance engineer of East Asian descent and a male reliability engineer of African descent, both wearing safety glasses and company-branded polo shirts, are looking at a ruggedized tablet. The tablet screen displays a colorful vibration analysis graph and a 3D model of a robotic arm with a specific joint highlighted in red. In the background, slightly out of focus, is a large, clean robotic arm on an assembly line. The lighting is bright and clean, emphasizing a high-tech, efficient environment. There is no text on the image.",
