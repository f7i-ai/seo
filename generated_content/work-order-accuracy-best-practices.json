  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, photo-realistic image inside a modern, clean manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a reliability engineer (wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-visibility vest) is holding a tablet, looking at a complex piece of industrial machinery (like a large compressor or conveyor system). The tablet screen is not visible, but the engineer is clearly inputting data or checking a schematic. In the background, a maintenance technician (wearing a blue hard hat and gloves) is inspecting a gauge on the machine. The lighting is bright and industrial, with a slight blue hue to suggest technology and cleanliness. The scene conveys precision, collaboration, and the integration of technology into manual work. No text or overlays in the image.",
