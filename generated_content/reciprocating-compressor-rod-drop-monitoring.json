  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, photorealistic image inside a modern industrial gas processing facility. In the foreground, a reliability engineer wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-visibility vest is inspecting a large reciprocating compressor. The engineer is looking at a tablet (back of device visible) while gesturing toward a specific sensor mounted near the packing case of the compressor cylinder. The background shows the massive scale of the machinery with piping, valves, and steel structures. The lighting is industrial but clean, highlighting the metallic textures of the compressor rod and the blue/grey paint of the equipment. No text or words should be visible in the image.",
