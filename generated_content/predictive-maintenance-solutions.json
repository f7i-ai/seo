  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, high-resolution hero image for a blog post about predictive maintenance solutions. In a clean, brightly lit, modern factory, a diverse team of two maintenance professionals, a woman of South Asian descent and a man of Hispanic descent, are collaborating. The woman holds a ruggedized tablet displaying colorful line graphs and data, pointing to a large, clean industrial electric motor. The man is using a handheld wireless vibration sensor, placing it on the motor's bearing housing. Both are wearing modern PPE, including safety glasses, hard hats, and company-branded work shirts. The background shows other machinery slightly out of focus, emphasizing the main subjects. The overall mood is professional, high-tech, and collaborative. No text on the image.",
