  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern, clean manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of three professionals (a maintenance manager in a white hard hat, a reliability engineer in a blue hard hat, and a plant operator in safety gear) are standing in a semi-circle looking at a large, mounted digital dashboard screen displaying real-time equipment efficiency graphs and downtime metrics. They are viewed from behind or the side, focusing on their interaction with the data. The background shows blurred high-tech automated machinery, yellow safety railings, and conveyor belts. The lighting is industrial but warm, highlighting the clarity of the data on the screen. No text should be legible on the screen, just graphical representations of data. The atmosphere conveys collaboration and high-tech efficiency.",
