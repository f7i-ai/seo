In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers and maintenance managers (men and women, various ethnicities) are wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. They are looking confidently at a large industrial machine (like a compressor or conveyor system). One person is holding a tablet (back of tablet visible only) as if checking data.
