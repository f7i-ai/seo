  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, photo-realistic wide shot of a modern, clean industrial manufacturing floor. In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are standing near a large, complex robotic assembly arm. They are wearing professional navy blue work uniforms, white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One technician is holding a rugged industrial tablet (showing only the back of the device), while the others are looking at a specific section of the machinery, discussing a procedure. The lighting is bright and professional, highlighting the stainless steel and advanced sensors of the equipment. No text or logos are visible. The focus is on the collaborative, high-tech nature of modern maintenance.",
