  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, professional photo of a modern industrial manufacturing floor. In the foreground, a diverse pair of maintenance professionals (one male, one female) are standing near a large, well-maintained centrifugal pump and motor assembly. They are wearing clean, professional PPE including white hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One professional is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet (showing only the back of the device), while the other is pointing toward a small, unobtrusive wireless vibration sensor mounted on the motor housing. The background shows a clean, organized factory environment with overhead conveyors and various piping systems, slightly out of focus to emphasize the foreground subjects. The lighting is bright and natural, conveying a sense of efficiency and advanced technology. No text or logos are visible. Full-body shot.",
