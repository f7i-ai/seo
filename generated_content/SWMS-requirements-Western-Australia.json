  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-quality hero image of a modern industrial maintenance setting in Western Australia. The scene features a diverse group of maintenance technicians (men and women) wearing standard high-visibility orange and yellow workwear, hard hats, and safety glasses. One technician is in the foreground, seen from behind or the side, holding a ruggedized tablet. The screen of the tablet is not visible, but they are clearly referencing it while looking at a large industrial electric motor or pump system. The background shows a clean but active manufacturing or processing plant with pipes, yellow safety railings, and industrial machinery. The lighting is bright and professional, emphasizing safety and technology integration. No text or words should be visible in the image.",
