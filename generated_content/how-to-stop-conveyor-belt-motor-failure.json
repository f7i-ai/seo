A male engineer of East Asian descent is holding a tablet displaying a colorful vibration spectrum graph. He is pointing to the screen and discussing it with a female technician of African descent, who is holding a handheld vibration analysis tool near a large electric motor on a conveyor system. Both are wearing clean uniforms, hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. The background is slightly blurred, focusing on the team and the equipment.
