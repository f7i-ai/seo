  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern yet active manufacturing facility. The lighting is a mix of cool industrial blue LED strips and warm natural light filtering from high windows. In the foreground, a diverse group of three reliability engineers (one female, two male) are standing near a large industrial conveyor motor. They are wearing full PPE including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. They are looking at a tablet held by the middle person, but we only see the back of the tablet case, not the screen. The focus is on their engagement and the machinery. The background shows blurred motion of production lines, emphasizing a busy, working plant. No text or overlays in the image. 8k resolution, high detail.",
