  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers (men and women) wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests are gathered around a large industrial pump. One engineer is pointing to a specific component on the machine, while another holds a tablet (back of tablet visible only) as if checking data. In the background, blurred but visible, are automated conveyor lines and robotic arms. The lighting is professional and industrial—cool blues and bright safety yellows. No text or holographic overlays in the air. The image conveys collaboration, technology, and industrial precision.",
