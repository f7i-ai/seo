  "image_prompt": "A wide-angle, photo-realistic shot of a modern industrial manufacturing floor in 2026. In the foreground, a diverse team of three maintenance professionals (two men, one woman) are standing near a large, high-tech centrifugal pump. They are wearing clean, professional PPE: white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility vests over navy work uniforms. One technician is pointing toward a small, glowing blue IoT sensor mounted on the pump's bearing housing. Another technician is holding a rugged industrial tablet, showing only the back of the device to the camera. The background shows a clean, well-lit facility with overhead conveyors and other automated machinery, slightly blurred to maintain focus on the team. No text or screens are visible. The lighting is bright and natural, suggesting a high-end, efficient workspace.",
