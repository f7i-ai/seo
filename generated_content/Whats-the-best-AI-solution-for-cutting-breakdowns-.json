  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern, clean manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a reliability engineer (wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-visibility vest) is viewed from behind, looking at a tablet held in their left hand. The tablet screen is not visible to the camera. The engineer is gesturing with their right hand toward a large, complex industrial conveyor system and motor assembly in the mid-ground. The lighting is dramatic but professional, highlighting the metallic textures of the machinery. In the background, slightly out of focus, another technician in blue coveralls is inspecting a sensor on a pipe. The atmosphere conveys high-tech efficiency and safety. No text or overlays in the image. 8k resolution.",
