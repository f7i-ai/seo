  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, cinematic wide shot inside a large industrial facility or remote mining site. In the foreground, a reliability engineer wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-visibility vest is inspecting a large industrial electric motor. The engineer is looking at the back of a rugged tablet held in their hand (screen not visible). Attached to the motor is a small, sleek, industrial wireless sensor (orange or industrial grey) with a small antenna. In the background, out of focus, are other industrial assets like conveyors or piping, suggesting a complex, distributed environment. The lighting is natural but highlights the sensor and the engineer's professional focus. No text in the image. 8k resolution.",
