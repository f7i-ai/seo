  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, wide-angle shot inside a modern, clean, and well-lit manufacturing facility in 2025. In the foreground, a diverse team of three maintenance professionals—a Caucasian male, a Black female, and an Asian male—are gathered around a large industrial pump and motor assembly. They are all wearing modern PPE: hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests over their work uniforms. The Black female is holding a ruggedized tablet displaying colorful graphs and data (like a vibration spectrum), pointing to a detail on the screen and discussing it with her colleagues. The pump is clean and appears well-maintained. In the background, other industrial machinery is visible but slightly out of focus, conveying a sense of a large, active operational environment. The lighting is bright and professional, with no harsh shadows. The image should feel collaborative, high-tech, and focused on proactive maintenance. There is no text or branding on the image.",
