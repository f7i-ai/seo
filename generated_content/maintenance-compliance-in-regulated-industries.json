In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance professionals and a QA manager are looking at a tablet (back of device visible, no screen content) while standing next to a large, stainless steel bioreactor. They are wearing pristine cleanroom gowns, hairnets, safety glasses, and gloves. The lighting is bright, clinical, and cool-toned (whites and blues). In the background, slightly out of focus, other automated machinery and conveyor systems are visible. The image conveys precision, cleanliness, and high-tech collaboration. No text or overlays.",
