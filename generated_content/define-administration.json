In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance professionals (men and women) are wearing standard PPE including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One engineer is holding a tablet, but only the back of the device is visible. They are looking toward a large, complex conveyor system in the background. The lighting is a mix of cool industrial LED and warm ambient light, highlighting the clean, organized nature of the facility. No text or screens are visible. The atmosphere conveys control, safety, and high-tech efficiency.",
