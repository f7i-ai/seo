They are both wearing hard hats and safety glasses. They are looking at a large, futuristic holographic display that floats in front of them, showing a 3D model of a gas turbine with glowing data points and predictive analytics charts overlaid on it. The control room in the background is clean, modern, and filled with screens showing plant schematics and data. The mood is focused and collaborative.",
