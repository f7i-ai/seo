  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, photo-realistic wide shot of a modern, clean industrial manufacturing floor. In the foreground, a diverse team of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are collaborating. They are wearing full PPE, including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility orange vests over professional work clothes. One technician is pointing toward a large, complex industrial pump system, while another holds a ruggedized tablet (shown from the back, no screen visible). The lighting is bright and professional, highlighting the metallic textures of the machinery. The background shows a well-organized production line with subtle motion blur to indicate activity. No text or digital overlays are present in the image. Full-body view of the professionals.",
