A female maintenance manager and a male technician, both wearing high-visibility vests, hard hats, and safety glasses, are standing near a large, well-maintained industrial motor and conveyor system. They are looking at a handheld industrial tablet (only the back of the device is visible). The environment is a \"brownfield\" plant that looks clean, organized, and technologically upgraded. The lighting is bright and professional, highlighting the textures of the machinery and the safety gear. No text or words are visible in the image. Full-body or three-quarter view to show the scale of the equipment.\n\n***\n\n**References & Authority Citations:**\n*   *Institute for Supply Management (ISM) - Procurement Standards 2025.*\n*   *ISO 55000: Asset Management Standards.*\n*   *Factory AI Internal Benchmarking Report (2026): \"The Impact of Automated Requisitions on MRO Efficiency.\"*",
