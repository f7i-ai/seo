  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance planners and engineers (wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests) are gathered around a large, transparent digital glass interface floating in the air. The interface displays a glowing, complex Gantt chart with blue and orange bars, dependency arrows, and efficiency metrics. The background shows blurred industrial machinery, conveyors, and robotic arms in motion. The lighting is cool industrial blue with warm highlights on the people. No text or words should be visible on the interface or in the background. Focus on the collaboration and the futuristic technology integration.",
