  "image_prompt": "A professional, photo-realistic scene in a modern 2026 industrial manufacturing facility. A diverse group of three maintenance professionals (two men, one woman) are standing near a large, complex piece of automated machinery. They are wearing clean, appropriate PPE including white hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One person is pointing toward a specific mechanical component of the machine while the others look on intently, engaged in a collaborative discussion. One team member is holding a rugged industrial tablet, but only the back of the device is visible. The environment is well-lit, clean, and showcases advanced technology like robotic arms and sensor arrays in the background. The focus is on the professional collaboration and problem-solving atmosphere. Full-body shots, no text or displays visible.",
