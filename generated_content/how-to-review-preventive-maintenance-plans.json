In the foreground, a diverse group of three professionals (a maintenance manager in a collared shirt and hard hat, a reliability engineer holding a tablet, and a senior technician in coveralls and safety glasses) are standing around a large industrial pump or conveyor motor. They are engaged in a serious but collaborative discussion, pointing at a specific component of the machine. The background is slightly blurred but shows a busy, high-tech factory floor with yellow safety lines and automated equipment. The lighting is bright and industrial. No text or overlays.
