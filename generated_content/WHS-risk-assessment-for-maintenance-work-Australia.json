  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-quality hero image set inside a modern, clean Australian manufacturing facility. The scene features a diverse group of maintenance technicians (men and women) wearing standard Australian PPE: high-visibility yellow/orange vests with reflective strips, safety glasses, steel-capped boots, and hard hats. One technician is holding a ruggedized tablet (showing only the back of the device) and appears to be inspecting a large industrial motor or pump system. In the background, blurred slightly, is a mix of heavy machinery and conveyor belts. The lighting is bright and industrial. The image conveys safety, professionalism, and modern technology integration. No text or overlays in the image.",
