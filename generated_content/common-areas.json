  "image_prompt": "A wide-angle, photo-realistic shot of a modern, high-tech industrial facility's common area lobby and shared corridor. The scene features a diverse group of three facility managers—two men and one woman—wearing professional attire topped with high-visibility safety vests, white hard hats, and safety glasses. One manager is pointing toward a sleek, wall-mounted HVAC control panel while the others look on. The environment is clean, with polished concrete floors, large windows showing a glimpse of a parking lot, and modern architectural lighting. The managers are shown full-body; one holds a tablet device, but only the back of the device is visible. No text or logos are visible in the image. The lighting is bright and natural, conveying a sense of professional oversight and operational excellence.",
