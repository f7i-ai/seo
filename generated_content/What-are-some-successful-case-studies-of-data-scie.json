  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern, clean manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of three professionals (a maintenance manager in a white hard hat, a data analyst holding a tablet showing a graph on the back of the device, and a technician in safety gear and high-vis vest) are standing near a large industrial conveyor system. They are looking at a specific component of the machine, engaged in a collaborative discussion. The background shows blurred industrial machinery, yellow safety walkways, and soft, cool-toned LED lighting typical of high-tech factories. No text or words should be visible in the image. The atmosphere should convey professionalism, technology integration, and teamwork.",
