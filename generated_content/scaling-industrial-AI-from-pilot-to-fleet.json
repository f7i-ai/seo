  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern, clean manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers and maintenance technicians (wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests) are walking down a wide aisle flanked by large industrial machinery. The focus is on a female engineer in the center holding a tablet (back of tablet visible only) pointing toward a large compressor unit, as if scanning it. The background shows a depth of field with rows of automated equipment, conveyors, and subtle digital overlays or holographic nodes (very subtle, not sci-fi cartoonish) indicating connectivity. The lighting is professional industrial lighting with a cool blue hue, emphasizing technology and cleanliness. No text or words in the image. 8k resolution.",
