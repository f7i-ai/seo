  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern, well-lit Queensland warehouse facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of industrial workers (men and women) are conducting a safety meeting. They are wearing full PPE including hard hats, high-visibility vests (orange and yellow), and safety glasses. One worker is holding a tablet (back of device visible only) gesturing toward a yellow forklift in the background. The background shows high racking shelves stocked with pallets and a clean, organized concrete floor. The lighting is natural mixed with industrial LED, creating a professional, safety-focused atmosphere. No text or words in the image.",
