  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, photo-realistic wide shot of a modern industrial facility during a planned maintenance turnaround. In the foreground, a diverse team of three maintenance professionals (two men, one woman) are standing near a large, partially disassembled centrifugal pump. They are wearing clean, professional PPE: white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility orange vests over blue work uniforms. One technician is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet (showing only the black back of the device), while the others are looking at the equipment. The background shows a clean, well-lit factory floor with other machinery, overhead cranes, and yellow safety railings. The lighting is bright and professional, suggesting a well-managed, high-tech environment. No text or logos are visible. Full-body shots of the professionals.",
