  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, high-quality image showing a diverse team of three industrial professionals in a clean, modern factory setting. A female maintenance manager of South Asian descent points to a tablet she is holding, which displays a graph. A male engineer of Caucasian descent with a hard hat and safety glasses looks on thoughtfully. A younger female operator of African descent in a hair net and company-branded polo shirt is engaged in the conversation, gesturing towards a piece of complex machinery in the background. The lighting is bright and professional. There is no text on the image. The focus is on collaboration and data-driven decision-making on the factory floor.",
