  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern, high-tech manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers and maintenance managers (wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests) are gathered around a large digital drafting table or tablet, looking at a complex schematic or workflow diagram. They look focused and professional. In the background, blurred but visible, are heavy industrial automated machines, perhaps a robotic arm or a conveyor system, with amber warning lights softly glowing, symbolizing a managed alert state. The lighting is industrial but warm, highlighting the teamwork and strategic planning aspect. No text or words should be visible in the image.",
