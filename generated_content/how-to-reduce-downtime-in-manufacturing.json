  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot of a modern manufacturing facility floor in 2026. The lighting is cool and industrial, with blue and steel tones. In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance professionals (a man and a woman) are wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. They are looking at a large industrial motor. The woman is holding a tablet (back of the tablet visible only) as if checking data, while the man points to a specific component on the machine. In the background, blurred automated machinery and conveyor belts are in motion, indicating a live production environment. No text or overlays. High resolution, professional depth of field.",
