In the foreground, a diverse maintenance technician (wearing safety glasses, a hard hat, and a high-visibility vest) is inspecting a large industrial pump motor. The technician is holding a ruggedized tablet in one hand (showing only the back of the device) and using a digital calibration tool on a sensor with the other hand. The background shows a clean, bustling factory floor with blurred conveyors and automated machinery. The lighting is professional and industrial, highlighting the precision of the work.
