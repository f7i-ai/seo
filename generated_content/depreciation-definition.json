On the left side, a modern industrial factory floor with a diverse group of maintenance technicians in safety gear (hard hats, safety glasses) inspecting a large, complex metallic turbine. The lighting is cool blue and industrial. On the right side, a blurred overlay of a financial balance sheet or graph with an upward trending line, visualized in warm amber tones. The image represents the connection between physical machinery and financial data. No text in the image. High resolution, 8k, cinematic lighting.",
