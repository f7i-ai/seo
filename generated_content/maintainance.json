In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance professionals (men and women) are wearing modern PPE including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One technician is holding a tablet (back facing the camera) while pointing at a large, complex industrial motor. Another technician is using a handheld thermal imaging camera on a nearby pump. The background shows automated conveyor belts and robotic arms in motion, with soft, cool blue lighting indicating a high-tech environment. No text or words should be visible in the image. The atmosphere should convey professionalism, technology, and proactive control.",
