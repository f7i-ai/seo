In the foreground, a reliability engineer (wearing a hard hat, safety glasses, and high-visibility vest) is inspecting a large electric motor. The engineer is holding a tablet (back of the device visible) that displays data graphs. In the background, diverse technicians are working on machinery. The environment is clean and high-tech, with subtle blue lighting indicating modern IIoT integration. Focus on the interaction between the human and the machine, conveying precision and technology.
