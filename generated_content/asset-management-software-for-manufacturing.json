  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot of a modern manufacturing facility floor. In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers and machine operators (wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests) are gathered around a large industrial conveyor system. One engineer is holding a ruggedized tablet, showing the back of the device (no screen visible), pointing toward a specific motor on the line. The background shows a clean, high-tech factory environment with blurred automated machinery and yellow safety walkways. The lighting is professional and industrial, with a mix of cool factory lighting and warm highlights on the machinery. No text or overlays in the image.",
