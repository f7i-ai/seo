In the foreground, a diverse team of three maintenance professionals—a Hispanic man, a Black woman, and an Asian man—are gathered around a ruggedized tablet. They are all wearing appropriate PPE: hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests over their work uniforms. The tablet screen shows a vibrant data visualization with a 3D model of a large CNC machine and several graphs indicating vibration, temperature, and RUL (Remaining Useful Life). The woman is pointing to a specific data point on the screen, engaging in a discussion with her colleagues. In the background, out of focus, is the actual CNC machine, with bright, energy-efficient LED lighting illuminating the workspace. The overall mood is collaborative, high-tech, and professional.",
