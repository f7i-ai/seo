  "image_prompt": "A hyper-realistic, professional wide shot of a modern Australian manufacturing facility interior. In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers (men and women) wearing high-visibility vests, hard hats, and safety glasses are inspecting a large industrial electric motor. One engineer is holding a generic tablet (back of device visible only) pointing toward a wireless sensor mounted on the motor.
