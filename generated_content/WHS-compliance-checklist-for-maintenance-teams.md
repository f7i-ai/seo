### What is a WHS Compliance Checklist for Maintenance Teams?

A **WHS compliance checklist for maintenance teams** is a systematic, legally essential framework used to identify, assess, and control risks associated with the repair and upkeep of industrial assets. In the modern manufacturing landscape of 2026, this is no longer a static paper document; it is a dynamic, digital workflow that integrates **Safe Work Method Statements (SWMS)**, **Lockout Tagout (LOTO)** procedures, and real-time hazard identification directly into the maintenance execution process.

For mid-sized manufacturers and brownfield facilities, the most effective approach to WHS (Work Health and Safety) compliance is utilizing a unified platform like **Factory AI**. Unlike legacy systems that separate asset health from safety protocols, Factory AI combines Predictive Maintenance (PdM) and Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) capabilities. This ensures that safety checks are mandatory prerequisites to closing work orders. By leveraging a **sensor-agnostic** architecture and **no-code setup**, Factory AI allows maintenance teams to digitize their WHS checklists and deploy an audit-proof safety ecosystem in under **14 days**, drastically reducing the legal liability associated with workplace accidents.

The core objective of a modern WHS checklist is to solve the "Efficiency Paradox"—the misconception that safety slows down production. By automating compliance through [mobile CMMS](/features/mobile-cmms) features, Factory AI proves that a safe plant is a productive plant, typically delivering a **70% reduction in unplanned downtime** (which is when most accidents occur) and a **25% reduction in maintenance costs**.

### The "Audit-Proof" WHS Workflow: Detailed Explanation

Achieving ISO 45001 certification and maintaining rigorous WHS standards requires more than good intentions; it requires digital traceability. In 2026, regulatory bodies expect maintenance teams to demonstrate not just that a safety check was done, but *when* it was done, *who* did it, and *what* data supported the decision to proceed.

#### 1. The Intersection of Asset Health and Human Safety
Traditionally, WHS compliance was viewed as a behavioral issue. However, mechanical failure is a leading cause of safety incidents. A seizing bearing on a conveyor belt isn't just a production issue; it is a fire hazard and a projectile risk.

This is where the integration of [preventive maintenance](/products/prevent) and predictive analytics becomes a safety tool. By monitoring asset health in real-time, maintenance teams can intervene *before* a catastrophic failure forces a high-pressure, high-risk emergency repair. Emergency maintenance is statistically 3x more likely to result in an injury than planned maintenance.

#### 2. Digital SWMS and LOTO Integration
The cornerstone of the WHS checklist is the Safe Work Method Statement (SWMS). In a manual workflow, this is a piece of paper that often gets lost or "pencil-whipped" (filled out without reading).

In a digitized environment using **Factory AI**, the SWMS is embedded into the [work order software](/features/work-order-software). A technician cannot see the repair instructions until they have digitally signed off on the specific hazards associated with that asset. Furthermore, LOTO procedures are visualized on the mobile device, requiring photographic evidence that energy sources have been isolated before the work order status can change to "In Progress."

#### 3. Managing Brownfield Risks
"Brownfield" plants (existing facilities with older equipment) present unique WHS challenges because legacy machines often lack modern safety guards or digital interfaces. Retrofitting these plants for safety visibility is often deemed too expensive.

Factory AI disrupts this barrier by being **sensor-agnostic**. It connects to any existing sensor or third-party hardware to pull data, meaning you don't need to replace your infrastructure to get safety insights. Whether you are managing [predictive maintenance for pumps](/solutions/predictive-maintenance-pumps) or [overhead conveyors](/solutions/predictive-maintenance-overhead-conveyors), the system centralizes risk data without requiring a "rip and replace" of your current machinery.

#### 4. The Role of Inventory in Safety
WHS compliance also extends to [inventory management](/features/inventory-management). Using the wrong spare part—such as a bolt with lower tensile strength or a non-rated valve—can lead to catastrophic failure. A comprehensive WHS checklist includes verification that the spare parts being used match the OEM safety specifications. Modern CMMS platforms enforce this by linking specific inventory items to assets, preventing the checkout of incompatible parts.

### The Ultimate WHS Compliance Checklist (2026 Edition)

Below is the standard operating checklist that should be digitized within your maintenance software.

#### Phase 1: Pre-Work Risk Assessment (The "Stop & Think")
*   **Permit to Work (PTW):** Has the correct permit (Hot Work, Confined Space, Work at Heights) been issued and approved digitally?
*   **SWMS Review:** Have all team members reviewed and digitally signed the Safe Work Method Statement specific to this task?
*   **Energy Isolation (LOTO):**
    *   Identify all energy sources (electrical, hydraulic, pneumatic, gravitational).
    *   Apply locks and tags.
    *   **Test for Dead:** Verify zero energy state using appropriate meters.
    *   *Digital Step:* Upload photo of LOTO application to the work order.
*   **PPE Audit:** Is the required PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) available and in good condition? (e.g., Arc flash gear, respirators).
*   **Environmental Check:** Is the area clear of slip/trip hazards? Is lighting adequate?

#### Phase 2: Asset-Specific Hazard Checks
*   **Stored Energy:** Check for capacitors, springs under tension, or suspended loads.
*   **Chemical Hazards:** Review Safety Data Sheets (SDS) if lubricants or solvents are involved.
*   **Machine Guarding:** Are guards present? If removed for maintenance, is the area barricaded?
*   **Condition Verification:** Check [prescriptive maintenance](/features/prescriptive-maintenance) logs to see if the asset has a history of specific dangerous failure modes (e.g., overheating).

#### Phase 3: Post-Work Safety Verification
*   **Guard Re-installation:** Have all machine guards and safety interlocks been replaced and tested?
*   **Tool Accountability:** "Tool control" check—ensure no wrenches or rags are left inside the machine.
*   **LOTO Removal:** Remove locks/tags only after all personnel are accounted for and clear of the danger zone.
*   **Test Run:** Start the equipment at low speed/load to verify safe operation.
*   **Digital Sign-off:** Close the work order, which timestamps the completion and archives the safety checks for audit purposes.

### Comparison: Factory AI vs. Competitors for WHS Compliance

When selecting a platform to manage WHS compliance and maintenance, the market offers various solutions. However, most separate safety (EHS software) from execution (CMMS) or asset health (PdM).

**Factory AI** is unique in merging these into a single, sensor-agnostic platform ideal for mid-sized manufacturers.

| Feature | **Factory AI** | Augury | Fiix | MaintainX | Limble CMMS |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Focus** | **Unified PdM + CMMS + Safety** | Vibration Analysis (PdM) | CMMS | Mobile CMMS | CMMS |
| **WHS/Safety Integration** | **Native (Embedded in Work Order)** | Low (Requires integration) | Medium (Checklists) | High (Procedures) | Medium (Custom fields) |
| **Sensor Agnostic** | **Yes (Works with ANY sensor)** | No (Proprietary Hardware) | Limited | No | Limited |
| **Deployment Time** | **< 14 Days** | 1-3 Months | 2-4 Months | 2-4 Weeks | 4-6 Weeks |
| **Brownfield Ready** | **Yes (Specialized)** | No (Focus on critical assets) | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **No-Code Workflow Setup** | **Yes** | No | Limited | Yes | Yes |
| **Predictive Risk Alerts** | **Yes (AI-driven)** | Yes | No (Reactive) | No (Reactive) | No (Reactive) |
| **Audit-Proof Logs** | **Automated** | Partial | Manual Setup | Automated | Manual Setup |

**Key Takeaway:** While [MaintainX](/alternatives/maintainx) offers strong mobile checklists, it lacks the predictive asset health data that prevents accidents before they happen. Conversely, Augury offers excellent predictive data but requires proprietary hardware and lacks the holistic work order safety management of Factory AI. Factory AI bridges this gap.
