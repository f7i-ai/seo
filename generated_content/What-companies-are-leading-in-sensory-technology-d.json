In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers (wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests) are inspecting a large electric motor. One engineer is holding a tablet (screen not visible) while pointing at a small, ruggedized wireless sensor mounted on the motor housing. The background features blurred automated conveyor lines and soft, cool industrial lighting. The atmosphere is professional, clean, and focused on technology-driven maintenance.
