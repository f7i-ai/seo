  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a reliability engineer (wearing a hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-visibility vest) is looking at a tablet held in their left hand (back of tablet visible, no screen content). They are standing next to a large industrial electric motor connected to a pump. On the motor, a small, modern wireless vibration sensor with a subtle LED indicator is visible. In the background, slightly out of focus, a diverse group of technicians is working on a production line. The lighting is a mix of cool industrial LED and warm ambient light, highlighting the texture of the machinery. The image conveys a sense of technology seamlessly integrated with heavy industry.
