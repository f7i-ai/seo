In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers and technicians (wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests) are gathered around a large industrial pump. One technician is holding a ruggedized tablet (showing only the back of the device) while pointing at the machine, consulting with a female engineer who is holding a digital multimeter. In the background, automated conveyor belts and robotic arms are in motion, slightly blurred to emphasize depth. The lighting is professional and cool-toned, highlighting the metallic textures of the machinery. No text or screens visible. High resolution, 8k.",
