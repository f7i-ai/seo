  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern, clean manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of three professionals (a Maintenance Director in a white hard hat, a Plant Manager in a blue hard hat, and a Reliability Engineer holding a tablet) are standing together, looking at a large industrial machine. They are engaged in a collaborative discussion, pointing at a specific component of the machine, symbolizing partnership. The lighting is professional and dynamic, highlighting the clean lines of the automated equipment in the background. The people are wearing safety glasses and high-visibility vests. The tablet screen is not visible (showing the back of the device). The atmosphere conveys high-tech efficiency and strategic collaboration. No text in the image.",
