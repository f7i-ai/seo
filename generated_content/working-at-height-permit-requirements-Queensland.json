  "image_prompt": "A hyper-realistic, professional wide shot of a modern manufacturing facility interior. In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance technicians (men and women) are conducting a safety briefing. They are wearing full PPE including hard hats, high-visibility vests, safety glasses, and fall arrest harnesses. One technician is holding a rugged tablet, showing the back of the device (screen not visible) to a supervisor. In the background, there is yellow industrial machinery, an overhead crane system, and clearly marked safety walkways. The lighting is bright and industrial. No text or words should be visible in the image. The atmosphere conveys safety, compliance, and modern technology.",
