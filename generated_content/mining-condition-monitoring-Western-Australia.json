  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot of a modern open-pit mine in the Pilbara region of Western Australia during the \"golden hour\" sunset. The rich red dirt of the mine contrasts with the metallic industrial structures of a processing plant in the mid-ground. In the foreground, a diverse group of three mining professionals (two men, one woman) are standing safely on a viewing platform. They are wearing full PPE: high-visibility orange shirts with reflective strips, hard hats, and safety glasses. The person in the center is holding a ruggedized tablet, but only the back of the tablet is visible (no screen content). They are looking out toward the conveyor systems and crushers. The lighting highlights the dust in the air and the scale of the operation. No text or logos in the image. Professional, industrial aesthetic.",
