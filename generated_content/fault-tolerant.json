  "image_prompt": "A high-tech, modern industrial control room in a clean manufacturing facility. A diverse team of three professionals—a woman in a white hard hat and safety glasses, and two men in high-visibility vests—are standing in front of a large, wall-mounted array of sleek, professional monitoring screens. One technician is holding a rugged industrial tablet, showing only the back of the device to the camera. The environment is brightly lit with cool LED lighting. In the background, through a large glass observation window, a highly automated production line with robotic arms is visible. The atmosphere is one of calm, focused expertise. The image is photo-realistic, professional, and contains no text or words. Full-body shots of the professionals are shown.",
