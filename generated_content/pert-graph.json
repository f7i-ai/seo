  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, professional photo-realistic scene in a modern mid-sized manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are standing together near a large industrial pump and conveyor system. They are wearing clean, professional PPE: white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility orange vests over work shirts. One person is holding a ruggedized tablet, but only the back of the device is visible to the camera. They are looking at the machinery and discussing a project, appearing focused and collaborative. The background shows a well-lit, organized factory floor with various pipes, motors, and electrical panels, suggesting a \"brownfield\" environment that has been modernized. No text or screens are visible. Full-body shot showing the industrial environment and the scale of the equipment.",
