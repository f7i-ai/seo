  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-resolution image inside a modern Australian manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (one female, two male) are wearing high-visibility vests, hard hats, and safety glasses. They are standing near a large industrial conveyor belt system. One technician is holding a ruggedized tablet, showing the back of the device to the camera (screen hidden). They are looking at a wireless sensor attached to a motor, discussing the equipment. The background is slightly blurred but shows a busy, clean factory floor with yellow safety lines and overhead piping. The lighting is industrial but warm, emphasizing a high-tech, safe working environment. No text or words in the image.",
