  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern Australian manufacturing facility or mineral processing plant. In the foreground, a reliability engineer wearing a high-visibility vest, hard hat, and safety glasses is inspecting a large industrial motor. The engineer is looking at the motor, not a screen. Attached to the motor is a small, sleek, wireless industrial IoT sensor with a subtle green LED indicator. The background shows depth with blurred conveyor belts and piping systems. The lighting is industrial but warm, highlighting the clean technology integration in a rugged environment. No text or overlays in the image.",
