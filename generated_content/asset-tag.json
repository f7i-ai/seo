  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, professional photo-realistic scene in a clean, modern industrial manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are collaborating near a large industrial pump system. They are wearing full PPE, including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility yellow vests. One technician is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet, showing only the back of the device to the camera. They are pointing toward a prominent, silver anodized aluminum asset tag with a QR code affixed to the side of the pump. The lighting is bright and natural, highlighting the metallic textures of the machinery and the professional focus of the team. No text or words are visible on the screens or tags. Full-body shots of the professionals are visible.",
