In the foreground, a diverse team of maintenance professionals (one man, one woman) are standing near a well-organized shelving unit containing industrial motors and gearboxes. They are wearing clean, high-visibility vests, white hard hats, and safety glasses. One person is holding a rugged industrial tablet, but only the back of the device is visible to the camera.
