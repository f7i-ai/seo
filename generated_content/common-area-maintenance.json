  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, photorealistic wide shot of a modern industrial logistics park at dusk. The scene features a clean, well-maintained asphalt loading area with clear striping. In the foreground, a diverse team of three maintenance professionals (two men, one woman) are conducting an inspection. They are wearing professional PPE, including white hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility yellow vests over work uniforms. One professional is pointing toward a large, roof-mounted industrial HVAC unit, while another holds a ruggedized tablet (back of the device facing the camera). The third person is checking a digital gate sensor. The lighting is crisp, highlighting the textures of the concrete and metal. No text or logos are visible. The atmosphere is professional, organized, and technologically advanced.",
