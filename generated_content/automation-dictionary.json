  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot of a modern manufacturing facility interior. The scene features a diverse group of maintenance engineers and technicians (men and women of various ethnicities) wearing standard PPE including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. They are standing near a large industrial conveyor system and a heavy-duty motor. One technician is holding a tablet device, but the screen is facing away from the camera (we only see the back of the device). The lighting is professional and industrial, with a mix of cool blue factory lighting and warm highlights on the machinery. The image conveys a sense of collaboration, advanced technology, and operational efficiency. There is no text or overlay in the image. The focus is on the people and the machinery working in harmony.",
