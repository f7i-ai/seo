  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, photo-realistic hero image of a modern industrial manufacturing floor. In the foreground, a diverse team of three maintenance professionals (two men, one woman) are collaborating near a large, complex piece of machinery that is undergoing a systematic overhaul. They are wearing professional PPE, including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility yellow vests. One technician is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet (shown from the back, no screen visible), while another points toward a specific section of the machine's internal gears. The environment is clean, well-lit, and represents a \"brownfield\" facility with a mix of heavy steel machinery and modern digital integration points. Full-body shots of the workers are visible, emphasizing a professional and safe working environment. No text or logos should be visible in the image.",
