  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, photo-realistic hero image of a modern industrial manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse team of two maintenance professionals (one male, one female) are standing on a clean mezzanine walkway overlooking a production line of conveyors and pumps. They are wearing professional PPE, including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility yellow vests over work shirts. One professional is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet (viewed from the back, showing a durable black casing, no screen visible), while the other is pointing toward a specific motor on the floor below. The background shows a well-lit, organized factory floor with various machines and pipes. The lighting is bright and natural, emphasizing a \"future-ready\" and safe working environment. Full-body shots, professional atmosphere, no text or digital overlays in the image.",
