  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-resolution hero image set inside a modern but active \"brownfield\" manufacturing facility. The scene features a diverse group of three professionals: a facility manager (female, mid-40s, wearing a white hard hat and safety vest), a maintenance technician (male, 30s, blue coveralls, safety glasses), and a plant director (male, 50s, business casual with safety gear). They are standing near a large industrial conveyor system with visible motors and pumps. The facility manager is holding a rugged tablet (back of device visible only) and pointing toward a specific component on the machinery, indicating a discussion about performance or metrics. The lighting is a mix of natural light from high windows and industrial LED lighting, creating a professional, operational atmosphere. No text or holograms in the image. Focus on the collaboration and the industrial equipment.",
