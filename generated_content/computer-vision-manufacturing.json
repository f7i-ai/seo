  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern, clean manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance technicians (wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests) are looking at a tablet held by one of them (only the back of the tablet is visible). They are standing near a large, complex industrial machine (like a conveyor system or robotic arm). Mounted on the machine is a distinct, high-tech industrial camera with a green LED status light, indicating it is scanning. The background is slightly blurred but shows a busy, active factory floor with sparks or motion, emphasizing productivity. The lighting is dramatic but professional, highlighting the integration of technology and human expertise. No text or overlays.",
