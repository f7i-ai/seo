In the foreground, a diverse team of two maintenance professionals (one man, one woman) are inspecting a large industrial induction motor. They are wearing full PPE, including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility orange vests. One professional is pointing at the motor's housing while the other holds a ruggedized industrial tablet (showing only the back of the device). The background shows a clean, well-lit factory environment with various pipes, conduits, and other machinery slightly out of focus. The lighting is bright and professional, emphasizing a high-tech, safe, and efficient workspace. No text or logos are visible on the equipment or clothing.",
