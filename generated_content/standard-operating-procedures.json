  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, high-resolution image inside a modern manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse maintenance technician (wearing a hard hat, safety glasses, and high-visibility vest) is viewed from behind, holding a ruggedized tablet. The tablet screen is visible but blurry, showing a digital checklist interface with green checkmarks. In the background, out of focus, is a complex industrial conveyor belt system and heavy machinery. The lighting is professional and industrial (cool blues and bright safety yellows). No text or words should be visible in the image. The atmosphere conveys efficiency, safety, and digital transformation.",
