The scene features a diverse group of three professionals: a female plant manager in a white hard hat and safety vest holding a tablet (screen hidden), a male maintenance technician in blue coveralls inspecting a large electric motor, and a male finance executive in a suit wearing a yellow safety vest and safety glasses. They are standing near a conveyor belt system. The lighting is cinematic, highlighting the machinery and the people. No text or overlays in the image. The atmosphere conveys collaboration between finance and operations. 2026 futuristic industrial aesthetic but realistic.",
