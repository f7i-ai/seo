  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern Australian processing plant or mining facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance professionals (men and women) wearing high-visibility vests, hard hats, and safety glasses are gathered around a large industrial pump. One engineer is pointing at a wireless vibration sensor mounted on the motor housing, while another holds a tablet (back of device visible only) showing a data dashboard. The background shows complex piping, conveyors, and steel structures, slightly blurred to emphasize the people. The lighting is a mix of natural light from high bay windows and industrial LED lighting, creating a professional, clean, and high-tech atmosphere. No text or logos in the image.",
