  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, wide-angle shot of a modern industrial manufacturing facility interior. The scene features a diverse group of maintenance engineers and technicians (men and women of various ethnicities) wearing full PPE including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. They are standing near a large, complex assembly line with metallic piping and robotic arms. One technician is inspecting a motor, while another in the foreground is looking at a tablet (only the back of the tablet is visible). The lighting is bright and industrial, with a mix of cool LED factory lights and warm indicators from machinery. No text or words should be visible in the image. The atmosphere conveys efficiency, technology, and safety.",
