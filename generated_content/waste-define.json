In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are standing near a large, well-maintained industrial motor and pump assembly. They are wearing clean, professional PPE: white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility yellow vests over work shirts. One technician is pointing toward a specific part of the machinery, while another holds a ruggedized industrial tablet (shown from the back, no screen visible).

The lighting is bright and natural, conveying a sense of high-tech efficiency and safety. No text or logos are visible. Full body shots of the professionals.",
