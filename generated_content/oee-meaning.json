  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, professional photograph of a diverse maintenance team—two men and one woman—standing in a modern but clearly established (brownfield) manufacturing facility. They are wearing clean, professional PPE including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One technician is pointing toward a large industrial motor assembly, while another holds a ruggedized industrial tablet (viewed from the back, showing a sturdy black case). The third technician is looking at the machinery. The lighting is bright and industrial, highlighting the textures of the metal and the clean floor. The shot is a full-body medium-long shot, capturing the scale of the machinery and the professional collaboration of the team. No text or digital overlays are visible.",
