The scene shows a maintenance technician in high-visibility gear and a hard hat placing a wireless IIoT vibration sensor on the bearing housing. The lighting is dramatic, highlighting the metallic textures and the contrast between the heavy, stationary machinery and the modern, small sensor technology.
