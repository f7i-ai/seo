In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers and maintenance technicians (wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests) are gathered around a large, complex industrial turbine. One engineer is pointing at a specific component on the machine while holding a tablet (back of tablet visible only). In the background, blurred slightly, are automated conveyor lines and digital dashboard screens glowing with data charts. The lighting is cool and professional, emphasizing a high-tech, \"Industry 4.0\" atmosphere. No text or words should be visible in the image.",
