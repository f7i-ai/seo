  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-quality image set in a modern industrial manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse reliability engineer (wearing safety glasses, a hard hat, and a high-visibility vest) is holding a tablet device, looking at a large industrial electric motor that has just been serviced. The tablet screen is not visible to the viewer (we see the back of the device). The engineer is using a handheld vibration sensor probe on the motor housing with their other hand. In the background, out of focus, another technician is organizing tools into a toolbox. The lighting is bright and industrial, highlighting the cleanliness and organization of the facility. The mood is professional, focused, and technical. No text or overlays in the image.",
