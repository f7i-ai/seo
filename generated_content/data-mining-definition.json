  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-resolution image inside a modern manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a reliability engineer (wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-visibility vest) is inspecting a large industrial motor. They are holding a tablet (back of the device visible only) as if checking data. In the background, blurred slightly to create depth, is a clean, automated production line with conveyors and robotic arms. The lighting is professional and industrial—cool blues and bright whites. No text or overlays in the image. The atmosphere conveys technology merging with heavy industry.",
