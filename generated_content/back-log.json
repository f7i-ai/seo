A female maintenance manager and a male technician are standing near a large, well-maintained industrial pump system. They are wearing appropriate PPE, including white hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility yellow vests. The manager is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet, but only the back of the device is visible to the camera.
