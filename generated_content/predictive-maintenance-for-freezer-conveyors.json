  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern industrial food processing facility. The focus is on a large stainless steel spiral freezer conveyor system. The environment looks cold; there is a subtle, atmospheric mist or fog near the floor indicating low temperature. In the foreground, a reliability engineer wearing a heavy insulated freezer suit, high-visibility vest, hard hat, and safety glasses is inspecting the side of the conveyor. They are holding a ruggedized tablet (back of tablet visible) as if checking data. A small, glowing wireless industrial sensor is visible mounted on a bearing housing on the conveyor. The lighting is industrial cool-white with blue undertones to emphasize the cold environment. No text or words in the image. High detail, 8k resolution.",
