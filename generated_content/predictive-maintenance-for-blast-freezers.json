  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a large industrial blast freezer facility. The scene is cold, with visible frost and mist in the air. In the foreground, a reliability engineer wearing a heavy insulated freezer suit, high-visibility vest, hard hat, and safety glasses is inspecting a large industrial evaporator fan unit. They are holding a tablet (back of device visible) to check data, but looking at the machinery. In the background, rows of racked pallets wrapped in plastic are visible, covered in a light frost. The lighting is industrial cool-blue with dramatic shadows, highlighting the scale and harsh environment of the facility. No text or overlays.",
