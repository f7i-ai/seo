  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern, high-tech manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers (a woman and a man) wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests are looking at a large industrial tablet held by the man (back of tablet visible only). They are standing next to a large, complex industrial motor and pump assembly that has several sleek, wireless orange sensors attached to it. In the background, the factory floor is clean and automated, with blurred motion of robotic arms or conveyors. The lighting is cool blue and industrial white, highlighting the clean lines of the machinery. No text or overlays. Focus on the interaction between the humans and the sensor-equipped machinery.",
