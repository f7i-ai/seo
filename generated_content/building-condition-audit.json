A diverse team of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are conducting a building condition audit. They are wearing clean, high-visibility vests, white hard hats, and safety glasses. One person is pointing toward a large, complex HVAC system and industrial piping, while another holds a ruggedized tablet (showing only the back of the device). The third person is inspecting a digital asset tag on a large motor. The environment is well-lit, clean, and represents a high-tech manufacturing setting. The focus is on the collaboration and the professional nature of the inspection. No text or displays are visible. Full-body shots showing appropriate PPE and work boots.",
