A diverse operator in clean PPE (high-visibility vest and hard hat) is looking at a large HMI screen filled with complex data visualizations. One section of the screen shows a red alarm notification, but the operator is focused on a different panel, illustrating the subtle reality of alarm fatigue. The lighting is cool and professional, emphasizing a high-tech manufacturing environment. No text on screens.",
