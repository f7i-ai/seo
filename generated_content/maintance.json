  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern, clean manufacturing facility in the year 2026. In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance technicians (men and women) are wearing futuristic but realistic PPE (hard hats with integrated lights, safety glasses, high-vis vests). One technician is holding a rugged tablet (showing the back of the device, not the screen) and pointing toward a large, complex industrial motor assembly. In the background, automated conveyors and robotic arms are in motion, slightly blurred to emphasize the depth. The lighting is a mix of cool industrial LED and warm accent lighting on the machinery, creating a professional, high-tech atmosphere. No text or words should be visible in the image.",
