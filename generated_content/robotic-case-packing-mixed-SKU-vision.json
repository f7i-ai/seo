  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-quality image inside a modern manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse team of two maintenance engineers (one male, one female) wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests are inspecting a robotic arm. The robot is equipped with a vacuum gripper and is in the process of picking various sized and colored boxes (mixed SKUs) from a conveyor belt. A 3D vision camera is mounted above the conveyor, emitting a subtle structured light pattern (blue or red lines) onto the boxes. The female engineer is holding a tablet (back of device visible only) checking data, while the male engineer points toward the vision sensor. The background is slightly blurred but shows a clean, high-tech industrial environment with safety fencing. No text in the image. Lighting is professional and industrial.",
