In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are standing near a large industrial motor assembly. They are wearing clean, professional PPE including white hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One technician is holding a rugged industrial tablet (showing only the back of the device), while the others are looking at the machinery. The background shows a well-organized facility with clear yellow floor markings and automated conveyor systems. The lighting is bright and professional, conveying a sense of high-tech efficiency and safety. No text or logos are visible on the equipment or clothing. Full body shots of the professionals are visible.",
