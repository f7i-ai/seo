  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern, clean industrial manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse maintenance technician (wearing a hard hat, safety glasses, and high-visibility vest) is viewed from over the shoulder or side-profile. They are holding a ruggedized tablet displaying a digital checklist with a green \"check\" icon visible on the screen. In the background, slightly out of focus, is a complex piece of automated machinery with yellow safety guards. Another worker in the background is inspecting a gauge. The lighting is professional and industrial, highlighting the integration of technology and manual labor. No text or words should be visible on the tablet screen or machinery.",
