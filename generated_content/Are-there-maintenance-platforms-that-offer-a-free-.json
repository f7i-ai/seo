  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-quality hero image inside a modern but active small manufacturing plant or machine shop. The scene features a maintenance manager (mid-40s, wearing a hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-visibility vest) standing next to an industrial conveyor system or CNC machine. They are holding a tablet device, but only the back of the device is visible (no screen content). In the background, a diverse team of technicians in PPE is working on equipment. The lighting is industrial but warm, highlighting the clean, organized nature of a modern facility. No text or overlays in the image. The atmosphere conveys efficiency, safety, and modern technology integration in a brownfield setting.",
