  "image_prompt": "A wide-angle, photo-realistic shot of a modern, clean industrial manufacturing floor. In the foreground, a diverse team of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are standing near a large, complex piece of machinery. They are wearing full PPE: white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility orange vests over work shirts. One person is holding an industrial tablet, but only the back of the device is visible to the camera. The background shows a continuous production line with stainless steel components and overhead conveyors, bathed in bright, natural light from high factory windows. The atmosphere is professional, efficient, and technologically advanced. No text or logos are visible. Full-body view of the workers.",
