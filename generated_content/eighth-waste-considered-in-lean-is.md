In the world of operational excellence, the principles of Lean manufacturing have been a guiding light for decades. Born from the Toyota Production System (TPS), Lean is a relentless pursuit of value for the customer by eliminating waste. For years, this pursuit was defined by the original seven wastes—often remembered by the acronym TIMWOOD. They provided a clear, actionable framework for maintenance managers, facility operators, and industrial leaders to streamline processes, cut costs, and improve quality.

But as industries evolved, so did Lean thinking. A critical realization emerged: you can optimize every process, perfect every workflow, and schedule every task with precision, but if you ignore the single greatest asset on your facility floor—your people—you are leaving the most significant source of value untapped.

This realization gave birth to a crucial addition to the Lean framework. So, what **is the eighth waste considered in Lean?**

The eighth waste is the **Waste of Non-Utilized Talent**, also referred to as the waste of skills, human potential, or intellect. It is the failure to leverage the creativity, experience, knowledge, and problem-solving abilities of your entire team. In 2025, in an era of advanced technology and fierce competition, ignoring this waste is not just a missed opportunity; it's a direct threat to your operational resilience and long-term success.

This comprehensive guide will not only define the eighth waste but will provide maintenance and operations leaders with a detailed roadmap to identify, measure, and systematically eliminate it from their facilities.

## The Original Seven Wastes (TIMWOOD): A Foundation for Excellence

Before we dive deep into the eighth waste, it's essential to have a firm grasp of the original seven that form the bedrock of Lean methodology. Understanding them provides the context for why the addition of the eighth waste was so revolutionary and necessary. The classic acronym is TIMWOOD or TIMWOOD-S.

### 1. Transportation
This waste involves the unnecessary movement of products, materials, or information from one location to another. Every time a part is moved, it adds no value to the final product, yet it consumes time, energy, and resources. For a maintenance team, this could be a technician walking back and forth across the plant to a poorly located tool crib or parts storage area.

### 2. Inventory
Excess inventory—whether it's raw materials, work-in-progress (WIP), or finished goods—is a significant drain on capital. It hides other problems (like production imbalances or defects), requires space for storage, needs to be managed, and risks becoming obsolete or damaged. For maintenance, this manifests as a cluttered MRO storeroom filled with unorganized, expired, or unnecessary spare parts.

### 3. Motion
While Transportation refers to the movement of materials, Motion refers to the unnecessary movement of people or equipment. This includes bending, reaching, turning, and walking. A poorly designed workstation that requires a technician to constantly search for tools or contort their body to access a machine's service panel is a prime example of the waste of motion.

### 4. Waiting
The waste of waiting occurs anytime work has to stop because a previous step isn't ready. This could be an operator waiting for a machine to be fixed, a production line halted for a material shortage, or a maintenance technician waiting for a work order approval or a required part to arrive. It is one of the most visible and frustrating forms of waste.

### 5. Overproduction
Considered by many Lean purists to be the worst of all wastes, overproduction means producing more, sooner, or faster than is required by the next process or the end customer. It leads directly to most of the other wastes, especially excess inventory. In maintenance, this could be performing PMs more frequently than necessary "just in case," consuming labor and materials without adding to the asset's reliability.

### 6. Over-processing
This waste involves doing more work or adding more steps to a process than is necessary from the customer's perspective. It's about using the wrong tool for the job or adding features that the customer doesn't value. For maintenance, this might look like over-engineering a simple repair, using unnecessarily tight tolerances, or creating overly complex reports that no one reads.

### 7. Defects
Defects are products or services that are out of specification and require rework, repair, or scrapping. This is a clear waste of time, materials, and labor. In a maintenance context, a defect is a failed repair that leads to a callback, an incorrectly performed PM that fails to prevent a breakdown, or installing the wrong spare part.

These seven wastes provided a powerful lens for improvement. But they primarily focused on the *process*. The eighth waste forces us to look at the *people* executing that process.

## Unveiling the Eighth Waste: The Underutilization of Human Potential

The addition of the eighth waste marks a significant evolution in Lean thinking, shifting from a purely mechanical view of efficiency to a more holistic, human-centric approach.

### What Exactly is the Waste of Non-Utilized Talent?

The waste of non-utilized talent is the gap between an employee's full capability and the portion of that capability you actually use. It's the loss of opportunities for improvement that occurs when organizations fail to engage their workforce in the continuous improvement process.

This waste manifests in many forms:
*   **Untapped Ideas:** Ignoring the front-line operator who has a brilliant idea for a simple fixture that could cut changeover time in half.
*   **Wasted Skills:** Assigning a highly skilled, certified welder to simple deburring tasks for weeks on end.
*   **Lost Creativity:** Micromanaging experienced technicians, preventing them from using their diagnostic skills to troubleshoot a complex problem.
*   **Poor Engagement:** Creating a culture where employees just show up, do the bare minimum described in their job description, and go home without ever feeling a sense of ownership or contribution.
*   **Stifled Ambition:** Failing to provide training, development paths, or opportunities for employees to grow their skills and take on more responsibility.

Essentially, it's treating your team members like pairs of hands instead of engaged, thinking, and creative partners in the business's success.

### Why Was It Added? The Evolution of Lean Thinking

The original Toyota Production System was developed in a specific cultural and historical context. While it always valued respect for people, early Western interpretations of Lean often over-emphasized the tools and processes (like Kanban, 5S, and Value Stream Mapping) at the expense of the human element.

As Lean principles spread globally, leading organizations began to realize that sustainable success wasn't just about optimizing workflows. It was about building a culture of continuous improvement. And a culture of continuous improvement cannot exist without engaged, empowered, and motivated employees. The people closest to the work are the ones who know it best. They see the small frustrations, the inefficiencies, and the potential safety hazards that managers and engineers might miss.

Recognizing non-utilized talent as a formal "waste" elevated its importance. It forced leaders to ask not just "How can we make this process faster?" but also "How can we empower our team to make this process better?"

### The Tangible Costs of Ignoring the Eighth Waste

The costs of this waste are not as immediately obvious as a pile of defective parts or a line of waiting trucks, but they are just as, if not more, damaging.

*   **Decreased Morale and Engagement:** Employees who feel their ideas are ignored and their skills are undervalued become disengaged. This leads to apathy, lower productivity, and a "not my job" mentality.
*   **Higher Employee Turnover:** Talented, ambitious people will not stay in an environment that stifles their growth. The cost of recruiting, hiring, and training new employees is substantial, not to mention the loss of invaluable institutional knowledge.
*   **Missed Improvement Opportunities:** The sum of hundreds of small, employee-driven improvements (Kaizen) often has a greater long-term impact than a single, large, top-down project. Ignoring the eighth waste means leaving this goldmine of ideas untouched.
*   **Stifled Innovation:** Breakthroughs don't just happen in the R&D lab. They happen on the shop floor. When you fail to listen to your team, you shut down a primary source of practical, real-world innovation.
*   **Increased Safety Incidents:** Engaged employees who feel ownership over their work area are far more likely to identify and report potential safety hazards. A disengaged workforce is a less safe workforce.

## How to Identify the Eighth Waste in Your Maintenance and Operations Teams

You can't eliminate a waste you can't see. Identifying the underutilization of talent requires a shift in focus from observing processes to observing and listening to people. Here are practical ways to spot it in your facility.

### Red Flags and Warning Signs to Look For

Walk your facility floor with this checklist in mind:
*   **Lack of a Suggestion System:** Is there a formal, visible, and *active* system for employees to submit ideas? If a suggestion box exists, is it covered in dust?
*   **Managers as Primary Problem-Solvers:** When a machine goes down, do managers and engineers immediately rush in to take over, or do they coach the operators and technicians to solve the problem themselves?
*   **Low Participation in Meetings:** During team huddles or CI meetings, is it the same one or two people doing all the talking? Is there silence when you ask for ideas or feedback?
*   **Rigid Job Descriptions:** Do employees ever say, "That's not in my job description"? This points to a culture where people are afraid or unmotivated to step outside their defined roles.
*   **High Employee Turnover:** Are you constantly training new faces? Conduct thorough exit interviews to understand if a lack of growth or voice was a contributing factor.
*   **Limited Training Opportunities:** When was the last time you offered cross-training, upskilling for new technology, or leadership development for your front-line team?
*   **"Us vs. Them" Mentality:** Is there a palpable divide between management and the shop floor, or between departments like production and maintenance? This friction stifles the collaboration needed to utilize talent effectively.
*   **No Recognition for Ideas:** When an employee does offer a good idea, is it celebrated and is the employee recognized, or does a manager take credit for it?

### Gemba Walks with a Focus on People

A Gemba walk ("go to the real place") is a cornerstone of Lean. To find the eighth waste, your next Gemba walk should focus less on the machine and more on the human. Instead of just observing the workflow, engage in respectful, open-ended questioning:
*   "What is the most frustrating part of your job?"
*   "If you had a magic wand, what is the one thing you would change about this process?"
*   "Is there a tool or piece of information that would make your job easier or safer?"
*   "What's something we are asking you to do that you think is a waste of time?"
*   "Have you had any ideas for improvement lately?"

The key is to listen more than you talk and to show genuine curiosity and respect for their expertise.

### Analyzing Employee Feedback and Surveys

Formal tools can provide quantitative data.
*   **Engagement Surveys:** Use reputable survey tools to measure factors like autonomy, recognition, and opportunities for growth. Don't just look at the overall score; dig into the comments.
*   **Exit Interviews:** These are a final, candid opportunity to learn why people are leaving. Ask specific questions about their relationship with their direct supervisor and whether they felt their skills were being used effectively.
*   **One-on-One Meetings:** Regular, informal check-ins are invaluable. Create a space where employees feel safe to share their career aspirations, frustrations, and ideas.

## A Step-by-Step Guide to Eliminating the Waste of Non-Utilized Talent

Identifying the waste is the first step. Eliminating it requires a deliberate, systematic, and sustained effort. It's not a one-time project; it's a cultural transformation.

### Step 1: Foster a Culture of Psychological Safety

Before anything else, employees must feel safe to contribute. Psychological safety, a concept popularized by Harvard professor Amy Edmondson, is the belief that you won't be punished or humiliated for speaking up with ideas, questions, concerns, or mistakes.
*   **Lead by Example:** Managers must admit their own mistakes openly. When a leader says, "I was wrong," or "I don't know, what do you think?" it gives permission for others to be vulnerable.
*   **Respond Productively:** When an employee brings up a problem or a "crazy" idea, the response should be "Thank you for bringing this to my attention. Let's explore that." Punishing the messenger, even subtly, guarantees you'll never hear from them again.
*   **Encourage Questions:** Frame work as a learning problem, not an execution problem. The goal isn't just to get the job done, but to learn how to do it better next time.

### Step 2: Implement a Robust Employee Suggestion (Kaizen) System

A suggestion box is not a system. A true Kaizen system is a closed-loop process.
*   **Make it Easy:** Provide simple forms (physical or digital) for submitting ideas. The barrier to entry should be as low as possible.
*   **Define the Process:** Create a clear, transparent process for how ideas are reviewed, who reviews them, and what the timeline is.
*   **Empower Small Changes:** Not every idea needs a committee review. Empower teams to implement small, low-cost, low-risk improvements within their own work areas immediately.
*   **Provide Feedback on Everything:** Every single idea deserves a response. Even if an idea isn't feasible, explain why in a respectful way. This shows that the input was valued and considered.
*   **Recognize and Celebrate:** Publicly recognize employees whose ideas are implemented. The recognition is often more powerful than a monetary reward. Tie it to company values and goals.

### Step 3: Invest in Cross-Training and Skill Development

A flexible workforce is a resilient workforce. Cross-training breaks down silos and increases the overall skill base of your team.
*   **Create a Skills Matrix:** For each team or area, create a matrix listing all the critical tasks and skills. Then, track the current skill level of each employee (e.g., 1-Not Trained, 2-In Training, 3-Certified, 4-Can Train Others).
*   **Develop Training Plans:** Use the skills matrix to identify gaps and create targeted training plans for individuals. This gives employees a clear path for growth.
*   **Upskill for the Future:** As technology evolves, proactively train your team on new systems. Don't wait until a new robotic cell or advanced sensor network is installed. Prepare them to be masters of the new technology, not victims of it. This is particularly crucial for adopting advanced maintenance strategies. For example, understanding the data from new systems is key to enabling [AI predictive maintenance](/features/ai-predictive-maintenance), which turns technicians from reactive mechanics into proactive reliability analysts.

### Step 4: Empower Operators with Autonomous Maintenance

Autonomous Maintenance (AM) is a pillar of Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) and a powerful way to combat the eighth waste. It involves transferring basic maintenance tasks—like cleaning, inspection, and lubrication—from the maintenance department to the machine operators.
*   **Benefits:** This doesn't just free up skilled maintenance technicians for more complex work. It empowers operators, giving them a profound sense of ownership over their equipment. They learn the "normal" operating conditions of their machines and become the first line of defense, often spotting subtle changes that predict a future failure.
*   **Implementation:** This requires structured training and clear, standardized guidelines. Developing clear and visual [PM procedures](/features/pm-procedures) is essential to ensure tasks are performed correctly and consistently by operators.

### Step 5: Leverage Technology to Unleash Human Potential

In 2025, technology should not be seen as a replacement for people, but as a tool to augment their intelligence and unlock their potential. A modern, connected maintenance environment is key.
*   **Centralize Knowledge with a CMMS:** A world-class [CMMS software](/products/cmms-software) acts as the central nervous system for your maintenance operation. It's not just for scheduling work orders. It's a platform for collaboration where technicians can document troubleshooting steps, attach photos and videos to work orders, and share tribal knowledge, preventing valuable information from walking out the door when an employee leaves.
*   **Automate the Mundane:** Use technology to automate repetitive, low-value tasks. This frees up your team's cognitive bandwidth for higher-level problem-solving. For instance, AI-powered systems can analyze sensor data to predict failures, allowing your team to focus on planning the repair and analyzing the root cause, rather than just firefighting.
*   **Empower with Mobile Tools:** A [mobile CMMS](/features/mobile-cmms) puts all the information a technician needs—asset history, manuals, schematics, spare part locations—in the palm of their hand, right at the asset. This empowers them to make better, faster decisions in the field without having to walk back to a desktop computer, thus reducing the wastes of waiting and motion and allowing them to fully apply their diagnostic skills.

## Real-World Impact: The ROI of Engaging Your Team

Eliminating the eighth waste isn't just a "feel-good" initiative; it has a direct and measurable impact on the bottom line.

### Case Study: The Automotive Supplier's Kaizen Culture

A Tier 1 automotive supplier was struggling with low morale, high turnover, and inconsistent quality. They launched a company-wide initiative focused on eliminating the eighth waste. They trained every employee in basic problem-solving, created a simple "Find it, Fix it" system for small improvements, and celebrated every implemented idea at weekly team meetings.
*   **The Result:** Within 18 months, they received over 5,000 employee-submitted ideas. Over 3,000 were implemented. Employee turnover dropped by 40%. First-pass quality yield increased by 12%. The cumulative effect of thousands of tiny improvements—like re-orienting a parts bin to reduce motion or adding a poka-yoke (mistake-proofing) pin to a fixture—transformed their operation and secured a major new contract.

### Calculating the ROI of Engagement

While some benefits like morale are hard to quantify, many are not. You can build a business case by estimating the value of:
*   **Cost Savings from Implemented Ideas:** (e.g., Idea to reduce scrap saves $X/month; Idea to reduce energy consumption saves $Y/year).
*   **Reduced Turnover Costs:** (Cost to hire + Cost to train + Lost productivity) x (Reduction in turnover rate).
*   **Increased OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness):** Link implemented ideas directly to improvements in Availability, Performance, or Quality. A 1% gain in OEE in a large facility can be worth millions.
*   **Reduced Safety Incidents:** Use your company's standard cost-per-incident calculation to quantify the savings from a lower incident rate.

## The Intersection of the Eighth Waste and Modern Maintenance

For maintenance and reliability leaders, addressing the eighth waste is the key that unlocks the door to higher levels of performance. It is the cultural foundation upon which technical excellence is built.

### From Reactive to Proactive: A Mindset Shift

A reactive, "firefighting" maintenance culture inherently creates the eighth waste. Technicians are running from one emergency to the next, with no time to think, analyze, or improve. They are being paid for their hands and their legs, not their brains.

Conversely, you cannot build a proactive, reliability-centered culture without tapping into the eighth waste. Proactive maintenance requires:
*   **Analysis:** Technicians performing root cause analysis (RCA) on failures.
*   **Planning:** Technicians helping to optimize PM routes and procedures.
*   **Observation:** Operators detecting subtle abnormalities in equipment.
*   **Data-Driven Decisions:** Teams analyzing trends in the CMMS to identify bad actors.

All of these activities require an engaged, empowered, and skilled workforce. As the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) points out, Lean is a total system for delivering value, and people are at the heart of that system.

### The Role of Leadership in Championing People

Eliminating the eighth waste is, above all, a leadership responsibility. It cannot be delegated to HR or a continuous improvement department. Managers and supervisors on the floor must:
*   **Be Coaches, Not Directors:** Shift from telling people what to do to asking them how it can be done better.
*   **Remove Barriers:** See their primary role as removing the obstacles that prevent their teams from succeeding.
*   **Listen Actively:** Spend more time on the Gemba walk than in their office.
*   **Provide Resources:** Ensure teams have the time, training, and tools they need to engage in improvement activities.

### Conclusion: Your Most Valuable Asset is Already on the Payroll

The seven original wastes of Lean provided a powerful framework for optimizing processes. But the **eighth waste considered in lean is** the waste of non-utilized talent, and it forces us to recognize a more profound truth: our greatest opportunities for improvement, innovation, and competitive advantage lie dormant within the minds of the very people who run our operations every single day.

In 2025, facilities that thrive will be the ones that move beyond simply managing their people as a resource to be scheduled and directed. The winning organizations will be those that lead their people, unleashing their collective intelligence to solve problems and create value.

Start today. Walk your floor, but this time, look past the machines. Look at your people. Ask them a simple question: "What can we do to make your job better?" The answer might just transform your entire operation.
