  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, high-quality professional image set in a modern, clean food and beverage bottling plant. In the foreground, a female maintenance manager of Hispanic descent and a male technician of Black descent are looking at a tablet together. The tablet screen shows a graph with a rising trend line and a green-to-red gauge, indicating predictive maintenance data. They are both wearing appropriate PPE: white lab coats, hairnets, and safety glasses. In the brightly lit background, a large, complex stainless steel filling and capping machine is visible but slightly out of focus. The overall mood is collaborative, professional, and tech-forward.
