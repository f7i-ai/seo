  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-resolution image inside a modern, clean manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse team of two maintenance technicians (one male, one female) wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests are inspecting a large, orange industrial robotic arm. The female technician is holding a tablet (back of device visible) displaying data charts, while pointing at the robot's \"elbow\" joint. The male technician is holding a specialized grease gun, looking at the joint. The background shows a blurred production line with other robots in motion, conveying a high-tech, active environment. Lighting is bright and industrial cool-white. No text or words in the image.",
