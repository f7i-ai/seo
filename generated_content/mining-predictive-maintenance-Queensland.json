  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-definition hero image depicting a modern open-cut mine site in Queensland, Australia. The scene captures the \"Golden Hour\" lighting with red dust and earth tones characteristic of the Bowen Basin. In the foreground, a diverse group of three mining professionals (two men, one woman) are wearing full PPE including high-visibility orange shirts with reflective strips, hard hats, and safety glasses. One engineer is holding a ruggedized tablet, showing the back of the device (no screen visible), pointing toward a massive dragline or conveyor belt system in the background. The background features heavy mining machinery and industrial structures. The image conveys technology, safety, and industrial scale. No text or logos in the image.",
