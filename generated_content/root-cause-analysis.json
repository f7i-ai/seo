  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, high-quality image of a diverse team of three maintenance professionals in a clean, modern manufacturing facility. A woman with dark hair in a ponytail, a man of East Asian descent, and a Black man are gathered around a large industrial pump. The woman is holding a ruggedized tablet displaying colorful graphs and data (from a CMMS). She is pointing at the screen while the two men look on, engaged in a collaborative discussion, occasionally gesturing towards the pump. All are wearing appropriate PPE: blue hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests over their work uniforms. The lighting is bright and professional, with a slightly blurred background of other industrial machinery. The image conveys a sense of teamwork, technology, and data-driven problem-solving. There is no text on the image.",
