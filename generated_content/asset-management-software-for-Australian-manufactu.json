  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-resolution hero image set inside a modern Australian manufacturing facility. The scene features a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (two men, one woman) conducting an inspection. They are wearing standard high-visibility vests (orange and yellow) with reflective strips, hard hats, and safety glasses. One engineer is holding a generic ruggedized tablet (viewed from the back, no screen visible) pointing it toward a large industrial conveyor motor. The background shows a clean but active production line with blurred machinery and yellow safety walkways. The lighting is bright, industrial LED lighting.
