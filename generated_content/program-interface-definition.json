  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a futuristic, high-tech manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of three industrial professionals (one female engineer in a white hard hat and safety glasses, two male technicians in high-vis vests) are standing around a large, holographic digital interface projecting from a console. The hologram displays a complex network of connecting nodes and lines, resembling a digital nervous system or constellation, connecting various 3D models of industrial machinery (pumps, conveyors, robotic arms). The background shows a clean, blurred production line with automated machinery. The lighting is cool blue and industrial amber. The professionals are looking at the data visualization with focus, not holding devices, but interacting with the workflow. No text in the image. 8k resolution, highly detailed.",
