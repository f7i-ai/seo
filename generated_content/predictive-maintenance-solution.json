  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, professional image for a manufacturing blog post. In the foreground, a female maintenance manager of South Asian descent with her hair in a bun and wearing safety glasses and a high-visibility vest, is looking at a ruggedized tablet. The tablet screen shows clear, modern data visualizations of machine health with green, yellow, and red status indicators. In the background, slightly out of focus, is a complex piece of industrial machinery with several electric motors and conveyor belts. A male colleague of African descent wearing a hard hat is visible in the background, inspecting one of the motors. The lighting is clean and bright, characteristic of a modern, well-maintained factory. The image should convey a sense of control, technology, and proactive management. No text on the image.",
