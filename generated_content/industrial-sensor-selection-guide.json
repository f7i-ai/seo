Attached to the cooling fins of the motor is a sleek, industrial-grade wireless vibration sensor with a small status LED glowing soft green. The background shows a depth of field with blurred production lines, conveyers, and a reliability engineer in safety glasses and a hard hat holding a tablet, looking at a digital twin visualization. The lighting is dramatic but professional, highlighting the integration of physical machinery with digital sensing technology. No text overlays. 8k resolution.",
