  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, photo-realistic hero image of a modern industrial manufacturing floor. In the foreground, a diverse pair of maintenance professionals (one male, one female) are standing near a large, well-maintained centrifugal pump and motor assembly. They are wearing full professional PPE, including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility orange vests over work shirts. One professional is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet; the viewer sees only the back of the tablet, which is a matte black protective case. They are looking at the machinery and discussing a maintenance task. The background shows a clean, organized factory environment with overhead conveyors and various stainless steel pipes. The lighting is bright and professional, suggesting a safe and efficient workplace. No text or logos are visible on the equipment or clothing. Full body shots of the professionals are included.",
