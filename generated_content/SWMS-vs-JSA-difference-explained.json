  "image_prompt": "A hyper-realistic, professional wide shot of a modern industrial manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance technicians (men and women) are gathered for a toolbox talk. They are wearing full PPE including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One technician is holding a rugged tablet (back of device visible only) gesturing towards a large piece of complex machinery, likely a conveyor system or large pump. The background is clean, well-lit, and high-tech, symbolizing Industry 4.0. No text or overlays in the image.
