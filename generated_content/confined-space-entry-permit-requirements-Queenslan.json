  "image_prompt": "A hyper-realistic, professional wide shot of a modern industrial manufacturing facility in Queensland. In the foreground, a diverse group of safety officers and maintenance technicians are conducting a toolbox talk near a large stainless steel mixing tank (confined space). They are wearing full PPE including hard hats, high-visibility orange and yellow vests with reflective strips, safety glasses, and steel-toed boots. One technician is holding a tablet (back of device visible only) showing a digital checklist. A tripod and winch system is set up over the tank entry point. The lighting is bright and industrial.
