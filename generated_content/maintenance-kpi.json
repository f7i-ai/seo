  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, wide-angle shot inside a modern, clean manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse team of three maintenance professionals—a middle-aged white male manager in a collared shirt and safety glasses, a young Hispanic female engineer with a tablet, and an older Black male technician in full PPE (hard hat, safety glasses, high-visibility vest)—are gathered around a large, brightly lit digital dashboard on a wall. The dashboard displays clean graphs and charts with maintenance KPI data (like OEE, MTTR, PM Compliance) using green, yellow, and red indicators. The team is engaged in a discussion, pointing at the screen. In the background, well-maintained industrial machinery like robotic arms and conveyor systems are visible but slightly out of focus. The lighting is bright and professional, conveying a sense of technological advancement and operational excellence. No text on the screen or anywhere else.",
