A reliability engineer in a clean uniform and PPE is using a handheld diagnostic tablet to inspect a high-performance servo motor mounted on a precision robotic arm. The background shows a clean, modern automated assembly line. The lighting highlights the motor's cabling and the encoder housing, illustrating a focus on the \"ghost in the machine\" electrical components. Photo-realistic, 8k resolution, professional industrial photography style.",
