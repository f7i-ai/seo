  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern, high-tech industrial manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers and maintenance technicians (wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests) are gathered around a large, ruggedized tablet held by one technician. The back of the tablet is visible, implying they are looking at a digital map or data overlay. In the background, blurred but recognizable, are heavy industrial machines, yellow robotic arms, and overhead conveyor systems. The lighting is a mix of cool industrial LED and warm ambient light, creating a professional, futuristic atmosphere. No text or screens are visible. Focus is on the collaboration and the integration of technology in a physical industrial space.",
