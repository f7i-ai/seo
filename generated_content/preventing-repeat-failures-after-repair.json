  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern, clean industrial manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse team of two maintenance professionals (one male, one female) wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests are inspecting a large electric motor and pump assembly. The female technician is holding a laser alignment tool (showing the back of the device, no screen visible) against the coupling. The male technician is holding a tablet (back facing camera) and pointing at a specific part of the machine. The background is slightly blurred but shows automated conveyors and bright industrial lighting. The atmosphere is calm, professional, and focused on precision, not chaotic repair.
