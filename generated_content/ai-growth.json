In the foreground, a reliability engineer (wearing a hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-visibility vest) stands with their back partially to the camera, looking at a large industrial pump system. They are holding a ruggedized tablet, but the screen is not visible to the viewer. The background shows a depth of field with blurred automated conveyor lines and soft, cool industrial lighting. Subtle digital overlays (like faint wireframe schematics or data nodes) are NOT present; keep it grounded in reality. The focus is on the interaction between the human professional and the heavy machinery. 8k resolution, high detail.",
