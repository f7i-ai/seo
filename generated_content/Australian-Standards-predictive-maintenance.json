  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot of a modern Australian industrial facility interior, blending heavy machinery with digital technology. In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers (men and women) are wearing standard Australian PPE (high-vis yellow/orange shirts with reflective strips, hard hats, safety glasses). One engineer is holding a ruggedized tablet (back of device visible only) pointing toward a large conveyor motor, implying data scanning. The background shows clean, well-lit heavy processing equipment (conveyors, pumps) with subtle digital overlays or holographic-style data visualizations floating near the machines to symbolize \"Digital Twin\" or AI monitoring, but without using text. The lighting is professional industrial cool-white with warm accents. No text or words in the image.",
