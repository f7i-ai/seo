  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern mineral processing plant. In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers and metallurgists (wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests) are standing on the walkway of a massive industrial tailings thickener tank. They are looking at a tablet held by one of the engineers (back of tablet visible only). The thickener tank is large, filled with grey slurry, with a complex steel bridge structure and a large central drive mechanism. The background shows the rest of the processing plant with pipes and steel structures, bathed in natural daylight filtering through the facility roof. The atmosphere is professional, industrial, and high-tech. No text or words in the image.",
