  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern, clean manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers and maintenance technicians (wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests) are gathered around a large industrial pump. One technician is pointing at a wireless sensor mounted on the pump motor, while another holds a tablet (screen not visible) referencing data. The background shows blurred production lines and automated machinery. The lighting is professional and industrial, with a mix of cool factory lighting and warm highlights on the equipment. The atmosphere conveys collaboration and advanced technology. No text or overlays.",
