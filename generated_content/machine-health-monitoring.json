  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, professional image for a manufacturing blog post. In a bright, clean, modern factory setting, a female maintenance manager of Hispanic descent and a male technician of Black descent are standing in front of a large, complex piece of industrial machinery (like a CNC machine or a robotic arm). They are both wearing proper PPE: safety glasses, and high-visibility vests over their work uniforms. The manager is holding a ruggedized tablet displaying a clean, modern user interface with colorful graphs and health scores, clearly showing machine health monitoring data. She is pointing to something on the screen, and they are both looking at it with focused, collaborative expressions. The background is slightly blurred to emphasize the people and the tablet. The lighting is bright and professional, conveying a sense of technological advancement and operational excellence. No text on the image.",
