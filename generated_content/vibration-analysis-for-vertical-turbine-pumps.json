  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-quality image inside a modern industrial water treatment facility or petrochemical plant. In the foreground, a reliability engineer wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, and high-visibility vest is inspecting a large, blue Vertical Turbine Pump. The engineer is holding a wireless vibration sensor (back of device visible) against the motor housing. The pump is tall, with a distinct discharge head and motor on top. In the background, blurred pipes and valves create depth. The lighting is professional and industrial, highlighting the texture of the metal and the seriousness of the maintenance task.
