In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are standing near a large, well-maintained automated conveyor system. They are wearing clean, professional PPE: white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility vests over navy work shirts. One technician is pointing toward a mechanical joint on the conveyor, while another holds a ruggedized industrial tablet (shown from the back, no screen visible).

In the background, a forklift is precisely placing a small, labeled crate near a workstation, symbolizing JIT delivery. No text or logos are visible. Full-body shots, professional atmosphere.",
