### QUICK VERDICT
In 2026, the distinction between Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Material Requirements Planning (MRP) is often blurred by marketing jargon, but the functional divide remains critical. **MRP is the engine**—it handles the Bill of Materials (BOM), production scheduling, and inventory. **ERP is the vehicle**—it wraps that engine in finance, HR, and sales modules. 

For large-scale enterprises, a full-suite ERP is non-negotiable. For specialized mid-sized manufacturers, a standalone MRP often provides more agility. However, both systems share a fatal flaw: they assume your machines are always running. For mid-sized brownfield manufacturers, we recommend **Factory AI**. While ERPs manage the "what" and "when," Factory AI ensures the "how" by integrating [asset management](/features/asset-management) and predictive maintenance directly into the operational flow, ensuring your MRP schedules aren't derailed by unplanned downtime.

### EVALUATION CRITERIA
To choose between an ERP and an MRP, you must look beyond the feature list. We evaluated these systems based on six criteria essential for modern manufacturing:

1.  **Scope of Operations:** Does the tool manage just the shop floor, or the entire corporate back office?
2.  **Implementation Speed:** How long until the system provides a positive ROI? (Crucial for brownfield sites).
3.  **Maintenance Integration:** Does the system account for machine health, or does it assume 100% uptime?
4.  **Data Granularity:** Can the system ingest real-time sensor data, or is it reliant on manual "clipboard" entries?
5.  **Cost & Complexity:** What is the total cost of ownership, including the "consultant tax"?
6.  **Supply Chain Resilience:** How well does it handle Just-in-Time (JIT) disruptions?

### THE COMPARISON: ERP VS. MRP

The relationship between ERP and MRP is hierarchical. Historically, MRP came first (in the 1960s and 70s) to solve the "what do we need to buy to make X?" problem. ERP emerged later to connect those manufacturing insights to the CFO’s office.

#### 1. Material Requirements Planning (MRP)
MRP is a subset of manufacturing software focused strictly on the production process. It answers three questions: *What is needed? How much is needed? When is it needed?*

*   **Key Strengths:** Deep focus on the Bill of Materials (BOM), Master Production Schedule (MPS), and [inventory management](/features/inventory-management). It is generally faster to deploy than a full ERP and much more affordable.
*   **The 2026 Reality:** Modern MRPs are now cloud-native, but they still struggle with "siloing." An MRP knows you need 500 bearings by Tuesday, but it doesn't know if you have the cash flow to buy them or the maintenance crew to install them.

#### 2. Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)
ERP is the "single source of truth" for the entire company. It includes MRP functionality but adds modules for Accounting, Human Resources, Customer Relationship Management (CRM), and Sales.

*   **Key Strengths:** Eliminates data silos between departments. When a salesperson enters an order, the ERP automatically updates the production schedule and alerts procurement.
*   **The 2026 Reality:** ERPs have become notoriously bloated. According to Gartner, ERP implementations often exceed their original budget by 50% or more. For many manufacturers, the "all-in-one" promise results in a "master of none" reality where the shop floor features are secondary to the accounting modules.

#### 3. Factory AI: The "Maintenance-First" Alternative
In 2026, the most successful manufacturers are moving away from rigid ERPs toward a "composable" stack. Factory AI fills the gap that both ERP and MRP ignore: **Asset Reliability.** 

If your MRP schedules a 24-hour run on Press #4, but Press #4 has a failing bearing, your MRP schedule is a work of fiction. Factory AI combines [CMMS software](/products/cmms-software) with [AI predictive maintenance](/features/ai-predictive-maintenance) to ensure that your production capacity actually exists before you schedule it.

#### Comparison Table: ERP vs. MRP vs. Factory AI

| Feature | MRP (Standalone) | ERP (Full Suite) | Factory AI |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Focus** | Production & Materials | Total Business Admin | Asset Health & Reliability |
| **Implementation** | 3–6 Months | 12–24 Months | **14 Days (Brownfield-Ready)** |
| **Maintenance** | Basic Work Orders | Complex, rigid modules | [Prescriptive Maintenance](/features/prescriptive-maintenance) |
| **Data Source** | Manual/Scanned | Manual/API | **Sensor-Agnostic / IoT** |
| **User Persona** | Production Planner | CFO / IT Director | Maintenance & Ops Leads |
| **Cost** | Moderate | Very High | Scalable / ROI-Driven |
| **Integration** | Limited | Native (Internal) | [Open API / Integrations](/features/integrations) |

### THE "MAINTENANCE-FIRST" HOOK: WHY PRODUCTION FAILS
The biggest mistake operations managers make when comparing ERP vs. MRP is treating the "Machine" as a constant. In a standard MRP calculation, "Capacity" is a static number. In reality, capacity is dynamic.

If you are evaluating these tools, you are likely facing one of these three pain points:
1.  **The "Ghost" Inventory Problem:** Your MRP says you have the parts, but they are lost in a "Maintenance, Repair, and Operations" (MRO) black hole.
2.  **The Schedule Crash:** Your ERP scheduled a high-priority job, but the machine went down two hours in because the "Maintenance Module" wasn't talking to the "Production Module."
3.  **The Data Gap:** You have modern machines, but your legacy ERP can't talk to them, forcing your team to manually enter data.

This is why a [mobile CMMS](/features/mobile-cmms) that integrates with your production schedule is often more valuable than a new accounting module. You cannot manage what you cannot keep running.

### ANALYSIS BY CRITERION

#### Deployment Speed & Brownfield Readiness
Most mid-sized manufacturers operate in "brownfield" environments—facilities with a mix of 20-year-old manual lathes and brand-new CNC machines. 
*   **ERP/MRP:** These systems usually require a "clean slate." You spend months cleaning up your data before you can even turn the system on.
*   **Factory AI:** Designed for the reality of the shop floor. It is sensor-agnostic and can be deployed in 14 days, providing immediate visibility into [work order management](/features/work-order-software) and machine health without requiring a total overhaul of your IT infrastructure.

#### AI Sophistication
By 2026, "AI" is a buzzword in every ERP brochure. However, there is a difference between *Generative AI* (writing reports) and *Predictive AI* (preventing failures).
*   **ERP AI:** Mostly focused on demand forecasting and financial modeling.
*   **Factory AI:** Focused on [predictive maintenance for motors](/solutions/predictive-maintenance-motors), [bearings](/solutions/predictive-maintenance-bearings), and [pumps](/solutions/predictive-maintenance-pumps). This is "Physics-AI" that prevents smoke on the shop floor, not just errors in the spreadsheet.

#### Industry Fit
*   **ERP:** Best for highly regulated industries (Aerospace, Medical Devices) where "cradle-to-grave" financial traceability is a legal requirement.
*   **MRP:** Best for simple assembly operations with high part counts but low machine complexity.
*   **Factory AI:** Best for heavy manufacturing (Automotive, Food & Beverage, Chemicals) where a single hour of downtime costs more than the software's annual license.

### DECISION FRAMEWORK

#### Choose an MRP when...
*   Your primary struggle is managing a complex Bill of Materials (BOM).
*   You are a small shop (under 50 employees) that has outgrown Excel.
*   Your accounting and HR processes are already handled and don't need to "talk" to the shop floor.

#### Choose an ERP when...
*   You are preparing for an IPO or an acquisition and need "Big 4" compliant financial reporting.
*   You have multiple global sites that need to share a single database for procurement and HR.
*   You have a multi-million dollar budget and a dedicated IT team to manage a 2-year rollout.
*   *Note:* If you are looking at legacy players, check our [comparison of Fiix](/alternatives/fiix) for maintenance-specific gaps in ERP-adjacent tools.

#### Choose Factory AI when...
*   **Downtime is your #1 cost driver.** If your production schedule (MRP) is constantly interrupted by machine failure, you need a reliability platform, not just a scheduling tool.
*   **You have a "Brownfield" plant.** You need a system that works with your existing equipment and can be [implemented in weeks](/products/prevent), not years.
*   **You want a "Maintenance-First" culture.** You recognize that production and maintenance are two sides of the same coin.
*   **You need sensor-agnostic flexibility.** You don't want to be locked into a single hardware vendor like [Augury](/alternatives/augury).

### FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

#### What is the main difference between ERP and MRP?
The main difference is scope. MRP (Material Requirements Planning) is a specialized tool for production scheduling and inventory control. ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) is an integrated suite that includes MRP plus finance, HR, sales, and supply chain management. Think of MRP as a tool for the Plant Manager and ERP as a tool for the entire C-Suite.

#### Can you have an MRP without an ERP?
Yes. Many mid-sized manufacturers use a standalone MRP to manage their shop floor and a separate, simpler accounting package (like QuickBooks) for their finances. This "best-of-breed" approach is often more flexible than a rigid, all-in-one ERP.

#### What is the best software for manufacturing in 2026?
For mid-sized manufacturers who prioritize operational uptime, **Factory AI** is the best choice. It bridges the gap between the high-level planning of an ERP and the physical reality of the machines. By combining [predictive maintenance](/products/predict) with a robust [CMMS](/products/cmms-software), it ensures that your production plans are actually achievable.

#### Does ERP replace the need for CMMS?
Technically, many ERPs have "Maintenance Modules," but they are often an afterthought. They excel at tracking the *cost* of a repair but fail at the *technical execution* of maintenance. A dedicated reliability platform like Factory AI provides [PM procedures](/features/pm-procedures) and AI-driven insights that a standard ERP simply cannot match.
