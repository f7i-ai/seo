  "image_prompt": "A wide-angle, photo-realistic shot of a modern, clean industrial manufacturing floor. In the foreground, a diverse group of three professionals—a female maintenance manager and two male technicians—are standing near a large, complex piece of robotic machinery. They are all wearing full PPE, including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility orange vests over professional work clothes. One technician is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet (shown only from the back, no screen visible), while the manager points toward a specific component of the machine. The lighting is bright and professional, highlighting the polished concrete floors and the organized, high-tech environment. No text or logos are visible on the equipment or clothing.",
