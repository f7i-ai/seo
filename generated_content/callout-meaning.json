  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, photo-realistic hero image of a professional maintenance team in a modern, well-lit manufacturing facility. A diverse group of three technicians (two men, one woman) are standing near a large industrial motor and pump assembly. They are wearing clean, professional PPE, including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility yellow vests over work shirts. One technician is pointing toward a part of the machinery while the others look on, engaged in a collaborative discussion. The technicians are shown from the waist up or full body. One technician is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet, but only the back of the device is visible to the camera. The background shows a clean, organized \"brownfield\" factory environment with various pipes, conduits, and other machinery slightly out of focus to emphasize the personnel. No text or logos are visible. The lighting is bright and industrial, conveying a sense of precision and proactive maintenance.",
