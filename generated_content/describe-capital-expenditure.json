  "image_prompt": "A wide-angle, photo-realistic shot of a modern, high-tech manufacturing facility in 2026. In the foreground, a diverse team of three professionals—a female maintenance manager in a white hard hat and high-visibility vest, and two male technicians in blue coveralls and safety glasses—are standing near a large, newly installed industrial robotic assembly arm. They are looking at the equipment with a sense of accomplishment. One technician is holding a ruggedized tablet, but only the back of the device is visible. The environment is clean, well-lit, and features advanced machinery with subtle IoT sensors attached. The background shows other production lines and large windows with natural light. No text or displays are visible. All personnel are wearing appropriate PPE, including hard hats, safety glasses, and steel-toed boots. Full-body view of the team.",
