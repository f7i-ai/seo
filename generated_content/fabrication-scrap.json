In the foreground, a diverse team of three professionals (two men and one woman) are standing near a large, clean industrial scrap collection system. They are wearing full PPE, including white hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One person is holding a rugged industrial tablet (showing only the back of the device). In the background, a large fiber laser cutting machine is visible, with sparks safely contained. The environment is brightly lit, organized, and reflects a \"Zero-Waste\" operational philosophy. No text or displays are visible.",
