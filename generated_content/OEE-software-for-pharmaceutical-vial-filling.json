In the foreground, a process engineer wearing a full aseptic gown (bunny suit), hood, goggles, and sterile gloves is looking at a transparent digital dashboard floating near a stainless steel vial filling machine. The machine is filling glass vials with clear liquid. The dashboard (seen from the back/side so no text is legible) displays complex data visualizations in cool blues and greens. In the background, another operator in full PPE is inspecting a conveyor. The lighting is bright, clinical, and cool-toned, emphasizing cleanliness and high technology. No text or words in the image. 8k resolution, cinematic lighting.",
