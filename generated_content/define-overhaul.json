  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern, clean manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse team of maintenance engineers (wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests) are gathered around a large industrial turbine or compressor that is partially disassembled for an overhaul. One engineer is pointing at a specific component, while another holds a tablet (showing only the back of the device) to reference data. The background shows active production lines with blurred motion to indicate activity. The lighting is professional and industrial, highlighting the complexity of the machinery and the expertise of the team. No text or words in the image. 8k resolution.",
