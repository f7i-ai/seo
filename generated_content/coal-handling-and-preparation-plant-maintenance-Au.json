  "image_prompt": "A hyper-realistic, wide-angle shot of a modern Coal Handling and Preparation Plant (CHPP) in the Australian outback during the golden hour. The scene features a complex network of conveyor belts, transfer towers, and a large wash plant structure. In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (two men, one woman) are conducting an inspection. They are wearing full Australian-standard mining PPE: high-visibility orange and navy shirts with reflective strips, white hard hats, safety glasses, and steel-capped boots. One engineer is holding a ruggedized tablet, but only the back of the device is visible (no screen content). The lighting highlights the dust-free, efficient nature of the plant, with a clear blue sky transitioning to sunset colors. No text or logos in the image. Professional, industrial aesthetic.",
