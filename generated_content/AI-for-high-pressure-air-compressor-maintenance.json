  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern industrial facility. In the foreground, a reliability engineer wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, and high-visibility vest is inspecting a large, industrial multi-stage high-pressure air compressor (painted blue or grey). The engineer is holding a tablet (back of tablet visible) as if checking data. In the background, out of focus, other facility infrastructure like piping and yellow safety railings are visible. The lighting is professional industrial lighting, slightly cool tones with warm highlights on the machinery metal. No text or overlays. The atmosphere conveys precision and modern technology.",
