A female technician in her 30s and a male manager in his 50s are standing near a large industrial pump and motor assembly. Both are wearing appropriate PPE, including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility yellow vests. The technician is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet (shown from the back, no screen visible), while the manager points toward a specific component of the machinery. The background shows a clean, organized \"brownfield\" factory floor with various pipes, sensors, and a conveyor system in the distance. The lighting is bright and natural, emphasizing a collaborative and high-tech industrial environment. Full-body shots, professional posture.",
