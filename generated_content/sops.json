  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-resolution image inside a modern manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse maintenance technician (wearing a hard hat, safety glasses, and high-visibility vest) is viewed from behind or the side, holding a ruggedized tablet. The tablet screen is not clearly visible, but the technician is looking from the device to a large industrial motor or pump unit that has a small, wireless sensor attached to it. The background shows a busy, clean factory floor with blurred machinery and perhaps another worker in the distance. The lighting is industrial but warm, highlighting the connection between the human worker and the machine. No text or overlays in the image. Professional, cinematic composition.",
