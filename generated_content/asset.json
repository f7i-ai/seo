  "image_prompt": "A hyper-realistic, cinematic wide shot of a modern manufacturing facility interior. The scene features a diverse group of reliability engineers and maintenance technicians (men and women of various ethnicities) wearing standard industrial PPE including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. They are standing near a large, complex industrial machine (like a turbine or conveyor system) that has small, glowing wireless sensors attached to it. One technician is looking at a tablet held by another, but only the back of the tablet is visible. The lighting is dramatic, combining cool industrial blue tones with warm amber safety lighting. The image conveys high-tech efficiency and operational control. No text or words in the image. 8k resolution.",
