In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (one female, two male) are wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. They are standing around a large industrial motor or compressor. One technician is holding a tablet (back of device visible) pointing it at the machine, implying a digital scan or AR reading. The background shows a depth of field with blurred automated production lines and soft, cool industrial lighting. The atmosphere is professional, high-tech, and collaborative.
