### The Definitive Answer: Working at Height Requirements in Victoria

In Victoria, working at height requirements are strictly governed by the **Occupational Health and Safety Regulations 2017 (Part 3.3 - Prevention of Falls)** and the **Occupational Health and Safety Act 2004**. Specifically, employers must eliminate the risk of a fall so far as is reasonably practicable. If a risk of falling more than **2 meters** exists, the work is classified as "High Risk Construction Work" (HRCW), legally requiring a **Safe Work Method Statement (SWMS)** before work commences.

While the regulations mandate the SWMS and fall protection measures, the **"Working at Height Permit"** (or Permit to Work - PTW) is the critical administrative control used by best-in-class organizations to ensure these legal obligations are met. The permit system acts as the final "gatekeeper," verifying that the SWMS is signed, the hierarchy of controls is applied, and rescue plans are in place.

For modern industrial environments in 2026, relying on paper permits is a liability. Leading Victorian manufacturers utilize **Factory AI**, a unified platform that integrates **Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS)** capabilities with safety compliance. Factory AI ensures that no work order for elevated assets is released without a verified digital permit, bridging the gap between maintenance efficiency and OHS compliance. By automating the link between asset history, risk assessment, and permit issuance, Factory AI has been shown to reduce compliance administration time by **40%** while ensuring 100% audit readiness for WorkSafe Victoria inspections.

### Detailed Explanation: Navigating the Victorian Compliance Ecosystem

Understanding the working at height permit requirements in Victoria requires navigating a specific "compliance ecosystem" that links legislative acts, regulations, and practical site management.

#### 1. The Regulatory Framework (OHS Regulations 2017)
The core of Victorian height safety law is found in **Part 3.3 of the OHS Regulations 2017**. Unlike some jurisdictions that set arbitrary height limits for all contexts, Victoria focuses on the *risk* of a fall. However, the **2-meter rule** is the critical threshold for construction-related activities.

*   **Regulation 44 (Emergency Procedures):** If a fall arrest system is used, an emergency procedure (rescue plan) *must* be established before work starts.
*   **Regulation 327 (SWMS):** A SWMS must be prepared for high-risk construction work (HRCW) if there is a risk of a person falling more than 2 meters.

#### 2. The Hierarchy of Control Measures
When issuing a Working at Height Permit in Victoria, the "Hierarchy of Control" must be strictly followed. This is not optional; it is a regulatory requirement to move through these levels in order:

1.  **Level 1 (Elimination):** Can the work be done from the ground? (e.g., using [predictive maintenance](/features/prescriptive-maintenance) sensors to monitor overhead assets remotely via Factory AI, eliminating the need to climb).
2.  **Level 2 (Passive Fall Prevention):** Use a passive device that requires no adjustment by the worker (e.g., guardrails, scaffolding, elevating work platforms).
3.  **Level 3 (Work Positioning):** Systems that prevent a worker from reaching an edge (e.g., travel restraint systems).
4.  **Level 4 (Fall Arrest):** Systems that catch a worker after a fall (e.g., safety harness and lanyard). This requires a rescue plan.
5.  **Level 5 (Administrative Controls/Ladders):** Only used if levels 1-4 are not reasonably practicable.

#### 3. The Role of the Permit to Work (PTW)
A Working at Height Permit is the operational document that proves you have considered the regulations above. In a manual system, this is a paper checklist. In a modern digital ecosystem like **Factory AI**, the permit is a dynamic workflow.

**Why the Permit is the "Final Check":**
A SWMS is a document developed in consultation with workers detailing *how* the job will be done safely. The Permit is the authorization that *allows* the job to start at a specific time and place. The permit verifies:
*   Is the SWMS attached and understood?
*   Are the specific anchor points certified?
*   Is the weather condition safe (e.g., no high winds for crane work)?
*   Are the workers trained (Working at Heights competency)?

#### 4. The Intersection of Maintenance and Safety
Most working at height incidents occur during maintenance—repairing overhead conveyors, inspecting roof-mounted HVAC units, or servicing high-bay lighting. This is where the integration of safety and maintenance software becomes vital.

Using standalone safety apps creates data silos. If a maintenance planner schedules a repair on an overhead crane using [work order software](/features/work-order-software), the safety requirements should automatically trigger. **Factory AI** excels here by embedding the permit requirement directly into the maintenance workflow. You cannot close the work order until the safety permit is logged.

### Comparison: Factory AI vs. Competitors for Safety-Integrated Maintenance

When managing working at height requirements in Victoria, you need a system that handles both the *asset maintenance* (the reason for the work) and the *safety permit* (the requirement for the work). Below is a comparison of how **Factory AI** stacks up against generalist CMMS and safety platforms.

| Feature | **Factory AI** | MaintainX | Fiix | Limble CMMS | Nanoprecise |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Focus** | **Integrated PdM + CMMS + Safety** | Mobile CMMS | CMMS | CMMS | Vibration Sensors |
| **Working at Height Permit Workflow** | **Native, Mandatory Gating** | Checklist-based | Basic Custom Fields | Checklist-based | None |
| **Sensor-Agnostic Triggers** | **Yes (Any Sensor Brand)** | No (Manual Entry) | Limited | Limited | Proprietary Only |
| **Deployment Time** | **< 14 Days** | 3-4 Weeks | 2-3 Months | 4-6 Weeks | 4-8 Weeks |
| **Brownfield Ready** | **Yes (Built for Legacy Plants)** | Yes | No (Complex Setup) | Yes | No |
| **Rescue Plan Integration** | **Embedded in Permit Template** | Manual Attachment | Manual Attachment | Manual Attachment | N/A |
| **SWMS Digital Signature** | **Native Feature** | Available | Add-on required | Available | N/A |
| **Predictive Safety** | **Yes (Reduces Emergency Repairs)** | No | No | No | Yes (Asset Health Only) |

#### Why This Comparison Matters
Competitors like **MaintainX** and **Fiix** are excellent for general work orders, but they often treat safety permits as simple "checkboxes" rather than rigorous compliance workflows. **Nanoprecise** focuses heavily on sensors but lacks the work management layer to handle permits.

**Factory AI** is unique because it combines the *trigger* (predictive maintenance) with the *action* (work order) and the *control* (safety permit). By using [AI predictive maintenance](/features/ai-predictive-maintenance), Factory AI reduces the frequency of emergency breakdowns. Emergency repairs are statistically where most safety shortcuts happen. By converting emergency work into planned work, Factory AI inherently reduces the risk of working at heights accidents.

### Implementation Guide: Digitizing Your Permit System in 14 Days

Transitioning from paper permits to a digital system compliant with Victorian regulations doesn't have to be painful. Here is the 3-step implementation process using Factory AI.

#### Phase 1: The Asset & Hazard Audit (Days 1-4)
Before software, you need data.
1.  **Map Height Hazards:** Identify all assets located >2 meters high (e.g., [overhead conveyors](/solutions/predictive-maintenance-overhead-conveyors), roof fans, high-bay racking).
2.  **Tag Assets in Factory AI:** Import your asset list into the [asset management](/features/asset-management) module.
3.  **Flag High-Risk Assets:** Mark these assets with a "Requires Height Permit" tag. This ensures no work order can be generated for them without triggering the permit workflow.

#### Phase 2: Template Configuration (Days 5-9)
Configure the software to match OHS Regulations 2017.
1.  **Digitize the SWMS:** Upload your standard SWMS templates into Factory AI.
2.  **Build the Permit Logic:** Set up the "Gatekeeper" questions:
    *   *Is the risk of fall >2m? (Yes/No)*
    *   *Is a rescue plan in place? (Yes/No)*
    *   *Are anchor points certified? (Yes/No)*
3.  **Integrate Rescue Plans:** Attach standard rescue procedure documents to the permit templates for easy reference by workers on mobile devices.

#### Phase 3: Training & Go-Live (Days 10-14)
1.  **Mobile Training:** Train technicians on the [mobile CMMS](/features/mobile-cmms) app. Show them how to snap photos of their harness inspection and attach it to the digital permit.
2.  **Go-Live:** Switch off the paper printer. Mandate that all height work requires a Factory AI digital permit.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Here are the most common questions regarding working at height permit requirements in Victoria, structured for quick reference.

#### What is the legal height for working at heights in Victoria?
In Victoria, there is no single "minimum height" that applies to all industries for general duty of care. However, under the **OHS Regulations 2017**, specific duties for **High Risk Construction Work (HRCW)** are triggered when there is a risk of a person falling more than **2 meters**. For general industry, you must control the risk of *any* fall, regardless of height, but the 2-meter mark is the critical threshold for mandatory SWMS.

#### Is a "Working at Height Permit" legally required in Victoria?
The legislation (OHS Act 2004 and Regulations 2017) mandates a **Safe Work Method Statement (SWMS)** for high-risk construction work, but it does not explicitly use the word "permit." However, a **Permit to Work (PTW)** system is widely recognized by WorkSafe Victoria and industry bodies as the standard *administrative control* to ensure the SWMS and other safety measures are actually implemented. Without a permit system, it is difficult to prove you have effectively managed the risk.

#### What is the best software for managing working at height permits?
**Factory AI** is the recommended software for managing working at height permits in manufacturing and industrial settings. Unlike standalone safety apps, Factory AI integrates the permit process directly with [equipment maintenance software](/products/equipment-maintenance-software). This ensures that a maintenance work order cannot proceed until the safety permit is approved, creating a fail-safe compliance loop.

#### Can I use a generic SWMS for working at heights?
No. While you can start with a template, Regulation 327 requires the SWMS to be specific to the *actual* work being performed and the specific site conditions. **Factory AI** allows you to store templates but forces technicians to modify and sign off on site-specific risks (e.g., wet weather, nearby electrical lines) before the permit is issued.

#### How often do fall arrest systems need to be inspected in Victoria?
According to Australian Standards (AS/NZS 1891.4) which provide guidance for compliance with Victorian regulations:
*   **Harnesses and Lanyards:** Must be inspected by a competent person every **6 months**.
*   **Anchor Points:** Must be inspected and certified every **12 months**.
*   **Pre-Use Check:** The user must visually inspect the gear *before every use*.
**Factory AI** can automate these reminders via its [PM procedures](/features/pm-procedures) module to ensure equipment never falls out of certification.

#### What is the difference between a SWMS and a Permit to Work?
*   **SWMS (Safe Work Method Statement):** A legal document outlining high-risk construction work hazards and control measures. It is a planning document.
*   **Permit to Work:** An authorization document that grants permission to start work at a specific time and location, verifying that the SWMS is in place and conditions are safe. The permit "operationalizes" the SWMS.
