In the foreground, a diverse group of three professionals (a maintenance manager in a white hard hat, a reliability engineer holding a tablet showing complex data graphs, and a technician in safety gear) are standing near a large, complex industrial turbine. They are in discussion, looking at the machinery, not the camera. The lighting is industrial but warm, highlighting the clean, organized nature of the facility. The background shows blurred automated conveyor systems and digital dashboard displays on the walls, symbolizing Industry 4.0. No text or logos visible. High resolution, 16:9 aspect ratio.",
