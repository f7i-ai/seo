  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern yet active \"brownfield\" manufacturing plant. The lighting is a mix of natural daylight from high windows and cool industrial LED lighting. In the foreground, a diverse group of three industrial maintenance professionals (one female, two male) are standing near a large industrial conveyor motor. They are wearing full PPE including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. The female technician in the center is holding a ruggedized tablet, but the screen is facing her (back of device visible to camera). They are looking at the machinery with a focused, collaborative expression. The background shows blurred production lines, yellow safety railings, and piping, emphasizing a busy, working factory environment. No text or overlays in the image. 8k resolution.",
