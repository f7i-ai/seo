  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern, clean industrial maintenance storeroom. In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance professionals (wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests) are consulting a tablet (back of device visible only) while looking at a neatly organized aisle of industrial parts. The shelves are stocked with motors, gearboxes, and boxed components, all clearly labeled with barcodes. The lighting is bright and cool, emphasizing technology and cleanliness. In the background, slightly out of focus, a blurred view of a production floor or automated machinery suggests the connection between the storeroom and the factory. No text or words should be visible in the image.",
