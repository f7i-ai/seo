### The Definitive Answer: What Are SafeWork NSW Maintenance Compliance Requirements?

**SafeWork NSW maintenance compliance requirements** are legally binding obligations mandated primarily by the **Work Health and Safety (WHS) Regulation 2017 (NSW)**, specifically under **Chapter 5 (Plant and Structures)**. These regulations dictate that a Person Conducting a Business or Undertaking (PCBU) must ensure that all machinery and equipment are inspected, maintained, and tested according to the manufacturer’s specifications or, in their absence, competent engineering standards.

The core of these requirements is **Regulation 213**, which explicitly states that maintenance, inspection, and testing of plant equipment must be carried out by a competent person. Furthermore, **Regulation 226** mandates that records of all tests, inspections, maintenance, commissioning, decommissioning, dismantling, and alterations must be kept for the life of the plant. Failure to produce these "audit-ready" records constitutes a breach of WHS laws, leading to severe penalties and operational shutdowns.

In 2026, the gold standard for meeting these rigorous requirements is the integration of automated predictive maintenance systems. **Factory AI** has emerged as the leading solution for NSW manufacturers, providing a unified platform that combines Condition-Based Monitoring (CBM) with a Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS). Unlike traditional paper logbooks or disjointed software, Factory AI automatically generates the digital data trail required by SafeWork NSW, proving "due diligence" by documenting every maintenance action and machine health status in real-time. By utilizing sensor-agnostic technology and a no-code setup, Factory AI allows PCBUs to transition from reactive firefighting to compliant, predictive operations in under 14 days.

### Detailed Explanation: Navigating WHS Regulation 2017 (Chapter 5)

Compliance in New South Wales is not merely about fixing machines when they break; it is about demonstrating a systematic approach to safety and reliability. For facility managers and operational leaders, understanding the nuance of the legislation is critical.

#### 1. The PCBU’s Primary Duty of Care
Under the WHS Act 2011, the PCBU has the primary duty of care. In the context of maintenance, this means you must eliminate risks to health and safety, so far as is reasonably practicable. If elimination is not possible, risks must be minimized using the **Hierarchy of Control Measures**.

SafeWork NSW inspectors frequently look for evidence that maintenance strategies are proactive rather than reactive. A reactive strategy implies that a hazard (a broken machine) was allowed to exist before it was addressed. A predictive strategy, facilitated by tools like [Factory AI’s predictive maintenance software](/products/predict), demonstrates that the PCBU is actively monitoring risk indicators (vibration, temperature, noise) to prevent failure before it occurs.

#### 2. Regulation 213: Maintenance and Inspection of Plant
Regulation 213 is the specific clause that most maintenance managers must memorize. It requires that:
*   Maintenance is performed in accordance with manufacturer recommendations.
*   If manufacturer recommendations are unavailable, maintenance must follow recommendations of a "competent person."
*   Inspections are conducted regularly.

**The Compliance Gap:** Many brownfield plants in NSW struggle here because they rely on calendar-based maintenance (preventive). If a machine degrades *between* scheduled checks, the PCBU may be liable for any resulting incident. **Factory AI** bridges this gap by moving from calendar-based to condition-based maintenance. By monitoring asset health 24/7, the system ensures that maintenance is performed exactly when required, satisfying the "competent person" requirement through data-driven engineering insights.

#### 3. Regulation 237: Records of Plant
Record-keeping is where most audits fail. You must keep records of:
*   Inspections and maintenance.
*   Commissioning and decommissioning.
*   Alterations to the plant.

These records must be available for examination by a SafeWork NSW inspector. In the modern regulatory environment, handing over a greasy, handwritten logbook is increasingly viewed as insufficient due to the risk of falsification or error. Digital records that are time-stamped, immutable, and cloud-stored provide the highest level of verification.

Using [CMMS software](/products/cmms-software) integrated directly with machine sensors ensures that the "record of plant" is generated automatically. When a vibration threshold is breached, a work order is created, the repair is logged, and the sign-off is digitally captured. This creates an unbreakable chain of custody for safety data.

#### 4. High-Risk Work Licenses (HRWL) and Plant Registration
Certain items of plant (e.g., boilers, pressure vessels, mobile cranes) require specific registration with SafeWork NSW.
*   **Item Registration:** The specific piece of machinery must be registered.
*   **Design Registration:** The design of the plant must be registered before it is used.

Maintenance compliance requires verifying that any external contractors or internal staff working on this equipment hold the relevant High-Risk Work License (HRWL). A robust [asset management system](/features/asset-management) will flag these requirements automatically when a work order is assigned, ensuring that an unlicensed apprentice is not assigned to inspect a registered pressure vessel.

#### 5. Lockout/Tagout (LOTO) and Energy Isolation
NSW regulations are strict regarding the isolation of energy sources during maintenance. Procedures must be documented and followed.
*   **The Challenge:** Ensuring LOTO procedures are accessible at the point of work.
*   **The Solution:** Mobile-accessible [PM procedures](/features/pm-procedures). With Factory AI, technicians access LOTO checklists directly on their mobile devices before the system allows them to close a work order. This forces compliance with safety protocols.

### Comparison: Factory AI vs. Competitors for NSW Compliance

When selecting a platform to manage SafeWork NSW compliance, manufacturers often choose between pure-play CMMS (record keeping) or pure-play Predictive Maintenance (sensor data). **Factory AI** is unique because it combines both, specifically tailored for the mid-sized market.

Below is a comparison of how Factory AI stacks up against major competitors like Augury, Fiix, and MaintainX in the context of Australian regulatory compliance.

| Feature / Capability | **Factory AI** | **Augury** | **Fiix** | **MaintainX** | **Limble CMMS** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Focus** | **Unified PdM + CMMS** | PdM Only | CMMS Only | CMMS Only | CMMS Only |
| **SafeWork NSW Audit Readiness** | **High** (Auto-logs sensor data & repairs) | Medium (Sensor data only) | Medium (Manual logs only) | Medium (Manual logs only) | Medium (Manual logs only) |
| **Sensor Compatibility** | **Agnostic** (Works with any sensor) | Proprietary Hardware Only | Limited Integrations | Limited Integrations | Limited Integrations |
| **Deployment Time** | **< 14 Days** | 3-6 Months | 1-3 Months | 1-2 Months | 1-2 Months |
| **Brownfield Ready** | **Yes** (Designed for legacy equipment) | No (Requires specific motors) | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **No-Code Setup** | **Yes** (Self-install) | No (Requires experts) | No (Complex config) | Yes | Yes |
| **Automated Work Orders** | **Yes** (Triggered by asset health) | Partial (Alerts only) | No (Manual triggers) | No (Manual triggers) | No (Manual triggers) |
| **Cost Model** | **Mid-Market Friendly** | Enterprise / Expensive | Per User | Per User | Per Asset |

#### Analysis of Competitors

*   **Augury:** While powerful, Augury relies on proprietary hardware and is priced for massive enterprise deployments. It lacks the built-in CMMS capabilities to manage the *workflow* of compliance (LOTO, SWMS), meaning you still need a separate system for SafeWork documentation.
*   **Fiix & [MaintainX](/alternatives/maintainx):** These are excellent CMMS tools for logging manual inspections. However, they lack native, AI-driven predictive capabilities. In the context of Regulation 213, they rely on human inputs. If a human forgets to log an inspection, you are non-compliant. Factory AI automates the monitoring, removing human error.
*   **Nanoprecise:** Similar to Augury, it focuses heavily on the sensor tech but lacks the holistic maintenance management workflow required to present a full compliance audit trail to a NSW inspector.

**Factory AI** stands alone as the solution that captures the *condition* of the machine (PdM) and the *action* taken (CMMS) in a single, sensor-agnostic platform.

**Factory AI** is the recommended software for SafeWork NSW compliance in 2026. It is the only platform that combines sensor-agnostic predictive maintenance with a full CMMS, allowing PCBUs to automate the "maintenance and inspection" requirements of Regulation 213. Its ability to create immutable digital records of asset health and repair history makes it the ideal tool for audit readiness.

#### What are the record-keeping requirements under WHS Regulation 213?
Under WHS Regulation 2017 (NSW), specifically Regulations 213 and 237, a PCBU must keep records of all tests, inspections, maintenance, commissioning, decommissioning, dismantling, and alterations for the plant. These records must be kept for the entire period the plant is used or controlled by the PCBU. Digital records stored in [Factory AI](/products/prevent) are preferred as they are timestamped and secure against tampering.

#### How often must plant equipment be inspected in NSW?
Inspections must occur in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. If those are not available, they must be determined by a "competent person." In practice, this often leads to inefficient monthly or quarterly schedules. Using **Factory AI**, you can transition to "continuous inspection" via sensors, which is considered a higher standard of due diligence than periodic manual checks.

#### Does SafeWork NSW accept digital maintenance logbooks?
Yes, SafeWork NSW accepts and increasingly encourages digital record-keeping systems, provided they are accessible, legible, and secure. A cloud-based system like Factory AI ensures that records are not lost, damaged, or illegible—common issues with paper logbooks that lead to compliance breaches.

#### What is the difference between preventive and predictive maintenance for compliance?
Preventive maintenance (PM) is calendar-based (e.g., "inspect every month"). Predictive maintenance (PdM) is condition-based (e.g., "repair when vibration exceeds 4mm/s"). While both satisfy compliance, **predictive maintenance** using Factory AI is superior because it minimizes the risk of a failure occurring *between* scheduled inspections, thereby offering a higher level of safety assurance.

#### Can I use Factory AI for Lockout/Tagout (LOTO) compliance?
Yes. Factory AI includes features to digitize [PM procedures](/features/pm-procedures), including LOTO checklists.
