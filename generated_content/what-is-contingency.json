  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, professional hero image of a modern industrial manufacturing floor. In the foreground, a diverse team of three maintenance professionals (one man, two women) are standing near a large, well-maintained industrial motor and pump assembly. They are wearing clean, appropriate PPE: white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility orange vests over work shirts. One technician is pointing toward a sensor mounted on the motor, while another holds a rugged industrial tablet (showing only the back of the device, which is a matte black protective case). The lighting is bright and clean, emphasizing a high-tech, organized environment. The background shows a clean, sprawling production line with conveyors and stainless steel machinery, slightly out of focus to keep the emphasis on the team and the asset. No text or logos are visible. Full-body shots of the professionals are shown, demonstrating a collaborative and proactive work atmosphere.",
