  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern, high-tech manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers (wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and reflective vests) are gathered around a large industrial motor. One engineer is holding a tablet (screen not visible) and pointing at a specific component on the motor, while another engineer inspects it with a thermal imaging tool. In the background, blurred slightly, are automated conveyor belts and robotic arms in motion. The lighting is a mix of cool industrial LED and warm accent lighting from the machinery indicators. The atmosphere conveys professional collaboration and high-tech precision. No text or overlays.",
