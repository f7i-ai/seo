  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, photo-realistic image of a stainless steel food processing conveyor line during a sanitation shift. A worker in full white PPE (apron, gloves, hairnet, face shield) is using a high-pressure water hose to clean the underside of the conveyor. Steam is rising from the belt. In the foreground, a close-up of a washdown-rated bearing housing shows water droplets and chemical foam clinging to the seal, illustrating the harsh environment that leads to the \"Sanitation Paradox.\" No text in the image.",
