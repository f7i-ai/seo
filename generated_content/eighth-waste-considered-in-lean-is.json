  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, photorealistic image set in a clean, modern manufacturing facility. A diverse team of three people—a female engineer of East Asian descent holding a tablet, a male technician of African descent pointing at the tablet's screen, and a younger Caucasian female operator—are gathered around a complex piece of industrial machinery. They are all wearing appropriate PPE, including safety glasses and branded work shirts. The atmosphere is collaborative and engaged; the engineer is listening intently to the technician, who is clearly sharing his expertise. The lighting is bright and professional, with a shallow depth of field that keeps the focus on the team while showing the industrial environment in the background. The image should convey a sense of empowerment, teamwork, and problem-solving. There should be no text or logos on the image.",
