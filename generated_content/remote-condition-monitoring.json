  "image_prompt": "A high-quality, photorealistic image for a blog post on remote condition monitoring. In the foreground, a female maintenance manager of South Asian descent with a determined expression is viewing a tablet. The tablet screen shows a dashboard with graphs and 3D models of industrial equipment with green, yellow, and red health indicators. In the background, slightly out of focus, is a clean, modern manufacturing facility with robotic arms and conveyor belts. A male colleague of African descent is in the background inspecting a large electric motor. Both individuals are wearing appropriate PPE, including safety glasses and high-visibility vests over their professional attire. The lighting is bright and clean, conveying a sense of technological advancement and operational excellence. The image should be shot from a slightly low angle to empower the subjects.
