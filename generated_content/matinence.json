  "image_prompt": "A wide-angle, photo-realistic shot of a modern, clean industrial manufacturing floor in 2026. In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (two men, one woman) are standing near a large, complex robotic assembly arm. They are wearing professional navy blue uniforms, white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One technician is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet (showing only the back of the device), while another is pointing toward a sensor housing on the robotic arm. The lighting is bright and natural, coming from high factory windows. The background shows other well-maintained machinery and a clean, polished concrete floor. No text or displays are visible. The focus is on the professional collaboration and the high-tech environment. Full-body view of the professionals.",
