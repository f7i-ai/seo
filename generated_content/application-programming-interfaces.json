In the foreground, a diverse group of three professionals—a female maintenance manager in a white hard hat and high-visibility vest, and two male IT/OT specialists in blue uniforms and safety glasses—are standing near a large, complex robotic assembly arm. One specialist is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet (shown from the back, no screen visible), while the manager points toward a series of integrated sensors on the machine. The lighting is bright and clean, highlighting the polished concrete floors and the organized, high-tech environment. All individuals are wearing full PPE, including hard hats, safety glasses, and steel-toed boots. The focus is on the collaboration between the people and the advanced machinery, representing the integration of software and hardware. No text or overlays.",
