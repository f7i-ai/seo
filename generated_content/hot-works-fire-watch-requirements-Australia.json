In the foreground, a maintenance worker in full PPE (high-vis orange vest, safety glasses, hard hat, welding gloves) is holding a tablet device (screen not visible) conducting a safety check. In the mid-ground, another worker is performing welding on a large metal structure, with sparks flying safely. A third person, the Fire Watch, stands attentively nearby with a red fire extinguisher, wearing a distinct vest. The background shows clean, color-coded piping and industrial machinery.
