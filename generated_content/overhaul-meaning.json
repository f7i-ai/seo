  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-resolution image inside a modern, well-lit industrial maintenance workshop. In the center, a large, complex piece of industrial machinery (like a large turbine or diesel engine block) is partially disassembled, sitting on a heavy-duty stand. A diverse team of three maintenance technicians is working on it. One technician (female, wearing safety glasses and a hard hat) is using a precision caliper to measure a component. Another technician (male) is inspecting a schematic on a tablet (back of tablet visible only). The third is organizing parts on a clean, organized workbench in the background. The environment is professional, emphasizing cleanliness and precision—not a dirty, dark garage. The lighting is cool and industrial. All personnel are wearing appropriate PPE including high-vis vests and gloves. No text overlays.",
