  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern industrial water treatment facility or pumping station. In the foreground, a large, industrial vertical turbine pump (painted blue or safety orange) stands prominently. A diverse group of reliability engineers and maintenance technicians (wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests) are inspecting the equipment. One technician is pointing towards the top of the motor where a small, wireless industrial sensor is mounted. Another technician is holding a tablet (back of device visible only) reviewing data. The background shows piping, valves, and soft industrial lighting. The atmosphere is professional, clean, and focused on technology-driven maintenance. No text or overlays in the image.",
