In the foreground, a diverse team of two maintenance professionals (one man, one woman) are collaborating. They are wearing clean, professional PPE: navy blue branded work shirts, hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One person is holding a rugged industrial tablet, showing only the back of the device.
