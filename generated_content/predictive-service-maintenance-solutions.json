  "image_prompt": "A high-quality, photorealistic professional image for a manufacturing blog post. In a bright, clean, modern factory setting, a female maintenance manager of color and a younger male Caucasian technician are standing in front of a large industrial electric motor. They are both wearing safety glasses and hard hats. The manager is holding a ruggedized tablet that displays a graph overlay on the motor, showing vibration data and a thermal image. They are looking at the tablet and discussing the data. The focus is on them and the technology, with the factory background slightly out of focus. The overall mood is professional, collaborative, and technologically advanced. No text or words on the image.",
