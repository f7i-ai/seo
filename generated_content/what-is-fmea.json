  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, photo-realistic wide shot of a modern, clean industrial manufacturing floor. In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are standing near a large, complex piece of machinery (a high-speed bottling line or a large industrial motor). They are wearing full professional PPE: white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility yellow vests over work shirts. One technician is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet, but only the back of the device is visible to the camera. They are pointing toward a specific section of the machine, engaged in a collaborative discussion. The lighting is bright and professional, highlighting the metallic textures of the equipment and the clean, organized environment of a top-tier manufacturing plant. No text or logos are visible. Full-body view of the professionals.",
