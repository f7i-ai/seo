  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-quality hero image of a modern Australian manufacturing facility interior. In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance professionals (a mix of men and women) are wearing standard Australian PPE (high-visibility yellow/orange vests with reflective strips, hard hats, safety glasses). One engineer is holding a rugged tablet, but the screen is not visible (showing the back of the device). They are looking at a large industrial conveyor system or motor. The background shows a clean but active brownfield factory environment with pipes, yellow safety railings, and industrial machinery. The lighting is bright and professional, emphasizing a high-tech, efficient atmosphere. No text or words in the image.",
