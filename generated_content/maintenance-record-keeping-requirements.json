  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern, clean manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance professionals (a man and a woman) are wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. The woman is holding a rugged tablet, showing the back of the device (no screen visible), appearing to scan a QR code on a large, complex industrial machine. The man is pointing at a specific component of the machine, holding a digital caliper. In the background, blurred slightly, are other automated machines and yellow safety walkways. The lighting is cool industrial blue with warm highlights on the workers, emphasizing a high-tech, safety-first atmosphere. No text or overlays in the image.",
