  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot of a modern manufacturing facility interior. The scene features a diverse group of maintenance engineers and plant managers (men and women of various ethnicities) wearing standard PPE including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. They are standing near a large, complex industrial conveyor system and a robotic arm. One engineer is holding a tablet (showing only the back of the device) while pointing at a sensor attached to a motor. The lighting is professional and dramatic, highlighting the clean, high-tech nature of the environment. No text or words should be visible in the image. The atmosphere conveys collaboration, technology, and industrial efficiency.",
