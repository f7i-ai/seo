  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, professional image for a manufacturing blog post. In a brightly lit, modern, and extremely organized industrial storeroom, a female maintenance manager of South Asian descent with a tablet is discussing inventory levels with a male storeroom clerk of Black descent who is holding a barcode scanner. Both are wearing safety glasses and high-visibility vests. The shelves behind them are perfectly organized with labeled bins containing various mechanical parts like bearings, belts, and fittings. The focus is on their professional interaction and the clean, data-driven environment. The image should have a shallow depth of field, with the background slightly blurred to emphasize the people. No text or logos on the image.",
