In the foreground, a diverse group of three professionals—a maintenance manager in a high-visibility vest and hard hat, a female engineer in safety glasses, and a facility director—are standing near a large, complex piece of automated machinery. They are discussing a project; one person is holding a rugged industrial tablet (viewed from the back).
