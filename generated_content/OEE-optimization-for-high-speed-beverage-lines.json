The foreground features a diverse group of reliability engineers and plant managers (men and women) wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. They are looking at a tablet held by one of the engineers (back of tablet visible only), pointing towards a blurringly fast conveyor line of glass bottles filled with amber liquid.
