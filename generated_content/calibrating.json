  "image_prompt": "A high-end, professional photo-realistic scene in a modern 2026 industrial laboratory. A diverse team of two maintenance professionals—one man and one woman—are working together. They are wearing clean, branded navy blue technician uniforms, hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. The woman is standing, holding a professional-grade calibration standard device (showing only the back of the device), while the man is kneeling slightly to inspect a complex industrial pressure transmitter mounted on a stainless steel pipe manifold. The background is a clean, well-lit facility with blurred-out high-tech machinery and organized tool stations. The lighting is bright and clinical, emphasizing a high-tech, precision-oriented environment. Full body shots, focused on the collaborative work and the sophisticated industrial setting. No text or screens are visible.",
