  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, high-resolution image inside a modern pharmaceutical packaging facility. The scene features a diverse team of two engineers (one male, one female) and a line operator. They are wearing full pharmaceutical PPE: white lab coats, hairnets, safety glasses, and blue nitrile gloves. They are standing near a sleek, stainless steel blister packaging line with a conveyor belt moving blister packs. The female engineer is pointing at a large digital dashboard screen mounted on the machine (back of screen visible or screen content blurred/generic data viz) while holding a tablet (back visible). The lighting is bright, clinical, and cool-toned, typical of a cleanroom environment. The depth of field focuses on the people and the immediate machinery, with the background slightly blurred showing more packaging equipment. No text or words should be visible in the image.",
