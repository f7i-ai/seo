  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, professional hero shot of a modern manufacturing facility floor. In the foreground, a diverse team of two maintenance professionals (one male, one female) are collaborating. They are wearing full PPE: white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility orange vests. One professional is holding an industrial tablet (viewed from the back, showing a rugged black case), while the other points toward a piece of orange Kubota industrial equipment in the mid-ground. The equipment has a clear, visible QR code asset tag on its side. The background shows a clean, well-lit \"brownfield\" factory setting with various pipes and machinery. The lighting is bright and natural, emphasizing a high-tech, efficient industrial atmosphere. No text or logos are visible on the tablet screen or in the air. Full body shots of the workers.",
