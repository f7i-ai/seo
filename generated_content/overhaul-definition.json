In the center, a large, complex industrial turbine or engine is being disassembled by a diverse team of three technicians. They are wearing modern safety gear: hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One technician is inspecting a large metal component with a digital caliper, another is referencing a tablet (back of device visible only), and the third is organizing parts on a clean layout table. The lighting is bright and cool, emphasizing precision and cleanliness. In the background, blurred industrial shelving and yellow safety markings are visible. No text or words in the image.",
