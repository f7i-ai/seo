In the foreground, a diverse team of two maintenance technicians (one male, one female) are consulting a digital tablet. They are wearing full PPE including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. The female technician is pointing at a specific component on a large, complex industrial machine in the background, which has a distinct red \"Lockout/Tagout\" lock and tag clearly visible on a breaker handle. The lighting is professional and bright, emphasizing safety and technology. No text or words should be visible on the tablet screen or in the background. The atmosphere conveys professionalism, safety compliance, and advanced technology.",
