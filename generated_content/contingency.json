In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (one female, two male) are gathered around a large industrial pump system. They are wearing full PPE including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One technician is holding a tablet (back of device visible only) pointing it at the machinery, suggesting digital diagnostics. The lighting is dramatic but professional, highlighting the complexity of the piping and machinery in the background. The atmosphere conveys focus, competence, and readiness, not panic.
