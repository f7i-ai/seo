  "image_prompt": "A professional photo-realistic scene in a modern, well-lit industrial warehouse. A diverse team of two maintenance professionals—one man and one woman—are performing an inventory audit. They are wearing full PPE, including white hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility neon vests over work shirts. One person is standing on a safety ladder checking a high shelf of organized mechanical components (large bearings and gearboxes), while the other stands below holding a ruggedized industrial tablet. We only see the back of the tablet, which is encased in a black protective shell. The warehouse background shows high-density racking with neatly labeled bins and a clean polished concrete floor. The focus is on the collaborative, methodical process of the count. No text or digital displays are visible. Full body shots showing professional work boots.",
