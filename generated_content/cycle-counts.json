In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are collaborating. They are wearing clean, high-visibility vests, hard hats, and safety glasses. One person is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet, but only the back of the device is visible to the camera. They are standing near a well-organized racking system with labeled bins of MRO spare parts like motors and gearboxes. The lighting is bright and natural, highlighting a \"brownfield\" environment that looks efficient and technologically advanced. No text or screens are visible. Full-body shots of the workers.",
