  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, professional, wide-angle shot of a modern, clean manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse team of three maintenance professionals—a Black woman with her hair in a net, a Hispanic man, and an Asian man—are gathered around a complex piece of industrial machinery. The Hispanic man is holding a ruggedized tablet displaying graphs and data (the equipment maintenance software interface), pointing to a specific part of the machine. The other two are looking intently at the machine and the tablet. All are wearing appropriate PPE: safety glasses, high-visibility vests over their work uniforms, and hard hats. The lighting is bright and clean, highlighting the advanced technology and collaborative atmosphere. There is no text or branding on the image.",
