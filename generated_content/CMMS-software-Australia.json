  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-resolution hero image set in a modern Australian manufacturing facility. The scene features a diverse maintenance team (men and women) wearing standard high-visibility vests (orange/yellow) and hard hats. In the foreground, a maintenance manager is looking at a large industrial machine (perhaps a conveyor or pump system) while holding a tablet device. The tablet screen is not visible (showing the back of the device). In the background, another technician is inspecting a sensor on a pipe. The lighting is professional and industrial, with a mix of natural light from skylights and cool LED factory lighting. No text or words should be visible in the image. The atmosphere conveys efficiency, safety, and modern technology integration.",
