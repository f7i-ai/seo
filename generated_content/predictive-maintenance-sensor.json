In the foreground, a diverse maintenance technician (wearing safety glasses, hard hat, and high-vis vest) is inspecting a large industrial electric motor. The technician is looking at a tablet held in their left hand (screen not visible to camera), while their right hand is near a small, wireless industrial sensor mounted on the motor housing.
