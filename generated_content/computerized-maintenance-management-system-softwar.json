  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, photo-realistic hero image of a modern manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse team of maintenance professionals (one man, one woman) are collaborating. They are wearing full professional PPE: white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility neon vests over industrial work clothes. One person is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet (viewed from the back, showing a protective black casing, no screen visible), while the other points toward a large, clean industrial motor assembly on a production line. The background shows a well-lit, organized factory floor with conveyors and robotic arms, slightly blurred to maintain focus on the technicians. The lighting is bright and professional, conveying a sense of advanced technology and safety. Full body shots of the individuals are visible, showing sturdy work boots. No text or logos are present in the image.",
