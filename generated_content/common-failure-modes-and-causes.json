  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern, clean industrial manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers and maintenance technicians (wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-vis vests) are gathered around a large industrial pump and motor assembly. One technician is pointing at a specific component on the motor, while another holds a tablet (back of tablet visible only) referencing data. In the background, blurred automated machinery and digital dashboards suggest a high-tech, Industry 4.0 environment. Lighting is dramatic but professional, highlighting the equipment and the team's focus. No text in the image.",
