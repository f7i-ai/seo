  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, professional photograph of a diverse group of three maintenance professionals—two men and one woman—standing in a modern, well-lit manufacturing facility. They are wearing full PPE, including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility neon vests. One person is holding an industrial tablet (viewed from the back, showing a rugged black case), while the others are looking toward a large, well-maintained piece of industrial machinery in the background. The scene conveys a sense of teamwork, safety, and advanced technology. The lighting is bright and clean, highlighting the metallic surfaces of the factory equipment. Full-body shot, photo-realistic, no text or digital overlays.",
