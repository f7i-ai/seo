  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern industrial manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a reliability engineer (wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-visibility vest) is viewed from behind, holding a ruggedized tablet. The tablet screen glows faintly, implying data analysis, but the specific text is not legible. In the background, out of focus, is a complex assembly line with metallic piping and yellow safety railings. The lighting is a mix of cool industrial LED and warm ambient light. The atmosphere conveys precision, technology, and industrial scale. No text overlays.",
