  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern, high-tech manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers and OT architects (wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests) are gathered around a large industrial machine. One engineer is pointing at a ruggedized edge computing unit mounted on the side of the machine, while others look on with interest. The background shows blurred automated assembly lines and digital overlays of data streams (subtle, not cartoonish) fading as they move away from the machine, symbolizing data processing at the edge. The lighting is cool industrial blue with warm accents on the people. No text in the image. 8k resolution.",
