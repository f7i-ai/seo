  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern but active \"brownfield\" manufacturing plant. In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance engineers (men and women, wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests) are gathered around a large industrial pump. One engineer is pointing to a specific component on the pump, while another holds a tablet (showing only the back of the device) as if checking data. In the background, blurred slightly, are conveyor belts and heavy machinery in motion, conveying a sense of productivity. The lighting is industrial but warm, highlighting the clean PPE and the professionalism of the team. No text or overlays in the image.",
