  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-resolution image inside a modern manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance technicians and engineers (wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests) are gathered around a large industrial pump system. One technician is holding a tablet (back facing the camera) while inspecting a sensor on the machine. In the background, the factory floor is busy but clean, with blurred conveyor belts and automated machinery. The lighting is bright and industrial, highlighting the professionalism and technology integration. No text or overlays in the image. The atmosphere conveys precision, collaboration, and advanced technology.",
