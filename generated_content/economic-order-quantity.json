  "image_prompt": "A wide-angle, photo-realistic shot of a modern, clean industrial warehouse and maintenance shop. In the foreground, a diverse team of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are standing near a large, well-organized rack of industrial spare parts (motors, bearings, and gearboxes). They are wearing clean navy blue work uniforms, white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One technician is holding a rugged industrial tablet, but only the back of the device is visible to the camera. They are engaged in a professional discussion, pointing toward a large industrial pump assembly in the mid-ground. The lighting is bright and natural, coming from high warehouse windows. The background shows a clean, organized factory floor with a conveyor system. No text or logos are visible. Full-body view of the professionals.",
