In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance engineers (men and women) wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests are gathered around a large industrial motor. One engineer is holding a tablet (back of the device visible) pointing it at the machine, implying an augmented reality or data scanning action. In the background, blurred automated conveyor lines and robotic arms are in motion. The lighting is cool industrial blue with warm highlights on the people. No text or overlays. 8k resolution.",
