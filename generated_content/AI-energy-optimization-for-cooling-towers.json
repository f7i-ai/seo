  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, high-angle shot of a modern industrial rooftop cooling tower system at sunset. The scene features two facility engineers, one male and one female, wearing full PPE including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. They are standing near a large cooling tower fan, looking at a tablet held by the female engineer (only the back of the tablet is visible). The cooling tower has visible IoT sensors attached to the motor housing and water piping, with subtle LED indicators. The background shows a blurred city skyline and a clear sky, emphasizing the \"air\" and \"cooling\" aspect. The lighting is golden hour, highlighting the metallic textures of the industrial equipment. No text overlays.",
