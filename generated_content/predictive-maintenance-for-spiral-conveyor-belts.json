  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern industrial food processing facility. The focus is on a large, stainless steel spiral conveyor system, rising vertically out of frame. The environment is clean but industrial, possibly with a hint of cold mist to suggest a freezer environment. In the foreground, a reliability engineer (wearing a hard hat, safety glasses, and high-visibility vest) is inspecting the drive motor of the spiral. They are holding a tablet (back of tablet visible) as if checking real-time data. The lighting is cool and professional, highlighting the metallic texture of the conveyor belt and the complexity of the machinery. No text or overlays.",
