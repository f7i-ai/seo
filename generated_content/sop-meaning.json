  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern, clean manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse maintenance technician (wearing a hard hat, safety glasses, and high-vis vest) is viewed from behind/over-the-shoulder. They are holding a rugged industrial tablet. The focus is on the technician and the machinery in front of them (perhaps a large conveyor system or automated assembly arm), not the screen of the tablet. The background shows a bustling but organized factory floor with other workers in PPE. The lighting is professional, mixing cool industrial LED lighting with warm highlights on the machinery. The image conveys technology, safety, and efficiency. No text or overlays.",
