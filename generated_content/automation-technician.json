  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, professional wide shot of a modern industrial manufacturing floor in 2026. In the foreground, a diverse pair of automation technicians (one male, one female) are collaborating. They are wearing clean, professional PPE including white hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One technician is kneeling slightly to inspect a sleek, modular control panel on the side of a high-speed robotic assembly line, while the other stands nearby holding a ruggedized industrial tablet (shown from the back, no screen visible). The background shows a clean, well-lit facility with advanced robotics and glowing blue and green status lights on the machinery. The atmosphere is focused and high-tech. No text or words are visible in the image. Full-body view of the technicians.",
