In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (two men, one woman) are standing near a large, complex piece of machinery. They are wearing full professional PPE: white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility orange vests over work uniforms. One professional is holding a rugged industrial tablet, but only the back of the device is visible to the camera. They are engaged in a serious, collaborative discussion, pointing toward a specific section of the machine (a large motor and pump assembly). The lighting is bright and professional, highlighting the metallic textures of the equipment. No text or screens are visible. The focus is on the teamwork and the industrial environment.
