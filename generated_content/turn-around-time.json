  "image_prompt": "A wide-angle, photo-realistic shot of a modern 2026 industrial manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse team of three maintenance professionals (two men, one woman) are collaborating near a large, complex piece of machinery. They are wearing clean, professional PPE: white and yellow hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility vests over work uniforms. One technician is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet, but only the back of the device is visible to the camera. The background shows a clean, well-lit factory floor with automated guided vehicles (AGVs) and other advanced machinery. The lighting is bright and natural, suggesting a high-tech, efficient environment. No text or displays are visible. The focus is on the professional interaction and the scale of the industrial setting.",
