  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-quality image of a modern industrial manufacturing facility floor. In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance professionals (men and women) are conducting an inspection. They are wearing full PPE including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One technician is holding a tablet device (showing only the back of the device) appearing to log data or take a photo of a large, complex piece of machinery. The background is clean and organized, reflecting a high-compliance environment, with safety markings clearly visible on the floor. The lighting is bright and industrial. No text or words should be visible in the image.",
