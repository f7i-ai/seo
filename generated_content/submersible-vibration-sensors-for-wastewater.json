In the foreground, a reliability engineer wearing a hard hat, safety glasses, and high-visibility vest is inspecting a control panel with a tablet in hand (back of tablet visible). In the background, heavy industrial piping and the top of a wet well hatch are visible. The lighting is industrial but dramatic, highlighting the clean, technical nature of modern maintenance.
