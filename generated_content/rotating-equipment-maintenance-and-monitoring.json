  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, high-resolution image of a modern industrial setting focusing on rotating equipment. In the foreground, a large industrial centrifugal pump and motor assembly painted in industrial blue or safety orange. Attached to the motor cooling fins is a small, modern wireless vibration sensor with a subtle LED indicator. In the background, out of focus, a reliability engineer in a hard hat, safety glasses, and high-visibility vest is looking at a tablet displaying a spectral waveform graph. The lighting is dramatic but professional, highlighting the contrast between the heavy steel machinery and the modern digital sensor technology. No text overlays.",
