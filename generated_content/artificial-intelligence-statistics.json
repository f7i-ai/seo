In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance engineers (men and women of different ethnicities) are wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. They are looking at a large, transparent holographic interface floating in the air (viewed from behind the interface so the text is reversed or abstract data visualization) that displays complex line graphs, heat maps of machinery, and efficiency percentages. In the background, blurred automated robotic arms and conveyor belts are in motion. The lighting is a mix of cool industrial blue and warm amber safety lights. The atmosphere conveys professionalism, advanced technology, and industrial reliability. No legible text.",
