  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, photo-realistic hero image of a modern industrial manufacturing floor. In the foreground, a diverse team of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are conducting a collaborative inspection of a large, complex pump and motor assembly. They are wearing clean, professional PPE: white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility orange vests over navy blue work shirts. One technician is pointing toward a specific component on the motor, while another holds a ruggedized industrial tablet (showing only the back of the device). The lighting is bright and professional, highlighting the clean, well-maintained environment of a \"brownfield\" plant that has been modernized. The background shows a blur of conveyors and stainless steel piping, suggesting a high-tech food and beverage or pharmaceutical facility. No text or logos are visible. Full-body shots of the professionals are shown to emphasize the scale of the machinery.",
