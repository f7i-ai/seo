  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, professional wide shot of a modern but established (brownfield) manufacturing floor. In the foreground, a diverse team of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are collaborating. They are wearing clean, professional PPE: white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility yellow vests over work shirts. One technician is pointing toward a large industrial motor assembly, while another holds a ruggedized tablet (viewed from the back, showing a sturdy black case, no screen visible). The third technician is looking at a mounted sensor on a nearby conveyor line. The lighting is bright and industrial. The background shows a clean, organized factory environment with various pipes, machinery, and a conveyor system. No text or logos are visible. Full-body shots of the workers are included to show the scale of the machinery.",
