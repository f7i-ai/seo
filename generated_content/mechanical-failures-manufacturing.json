  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern, high-tech manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers and maintenance technicians (wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests) are gathered around a large industrial motor and conveyor system. One engineer is using a handheld vibration analysis tool on the motor housing (back of device visible), while another holds a tablet (screen not visible) pointing toward a specific component. In the background, the production line is active but clean and well-lit with cool blue and white industrial lighting. The atmosphere is professional and focused on precision. No text or overlays in the image.",
