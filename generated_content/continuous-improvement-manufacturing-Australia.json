  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern Australian manufacturing facility. The lighting is a mix of natural light from high windows and cool industrial LED lighting. In the foreground, a diverse group of three professionals (a female plant manager in a white hard hat and high-vis vest, a male maintenance technician in blue overalls and safety glasses, and a reliability engineer) are standing near a large conveyor system. They are looking at a tablet held by the manager (only the back of the tablet is visible). The background shows active machinery, yellow safety walkways, and blurred motion of production.
