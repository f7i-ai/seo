  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance technicians (men and women, mixed ages) are gathered around a large industrial motor. They are wearing standard PPE: hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One older technician is pointing at a specific component of the motor, while a younger technician holds a ruggedized tablet (showing only the back of the device) and appears to be listening intently. The lighting is industrial but warm, highlighting the collaboration. In the background, blurred conveyor belts and machinery suggest a busy production environment. No text or overlays. The mood is professional, collaborative, and focused on mentorship.",
