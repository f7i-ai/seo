  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern Australian manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance professionals (men and women) are wearing standard Australian PPE: high-visibility yellow/orange vests with reflective tape, hard hats, safety glasses, and steel-capped boots. One technician is holding a tablet (back of device visible only) gesturing toward a large industrial conveyor motor. The background shows a mix of heavy machinery, piping, and clean industrial flooring. The lighting is bright and professional, highlighting a blend of gritty industrial reality with modern technological efficiency. No text or overlays in the image.",
