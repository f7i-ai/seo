  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers (men and women) wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests are inspecting a large industrial electric motor and pump assembly. One engineer is pointing to a small, wireless vibration sensor mounted on the motor housing. In the background, out of focus, is a clean, busy production line. The lighting is industrial but warm, highlighting the technology and the people. No text or digital overlays. The atmosphere conveys professionalism, safety, and advanced technology.",
