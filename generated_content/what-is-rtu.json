  "image_prompt": "A high-angle, professional photo-realistic shot of a modern industrial rooftop during the day. In the foreground, a diverse team of two maintenance professionals (one male, one female) wearing clean high-visibility vests, white hard hats, and safety glasses are standing next to a large, silver industrial HVAC Rooftop Unit (RTU). One professional is pointing toward the unit's access panel while the other holds a ruggedized industrial tablet (showing only the back of the device). In the background, the blurred skyline of a manufacturing district is visible. The lighting is bright and natural. The professionals are shown full-body, demonstrating a collaborative and safe working environment. No text or logos are visible on the equipment or clothing. External sensors are neatly mounted on the side of the RTU with professional conduit.",
