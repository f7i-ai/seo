  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern, clean industrial manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse maintenance technician (wearing a hard hat, safety glasses, and high-visibility vest) is holding a ruggedized tablet. The screen of the tablet is not visible to the viewer, but the technician is looking from the tablet to a complex piece of industrial machinery (like a large pump or conveyor motor) as if verifying a step. In the background, slightly out of focus, another worker is inspecting a different machine. The lighting is professional and cool-toned, emphasizing technology and safety. No text or overlays in the image.",
