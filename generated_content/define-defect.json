  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers and maintenance technicians (wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests) are gathered around a large industrial pump system. One engineer is pointing to a specific component on the machine, while another holds a tablet (back of device visible only) showing a data visualization graph. The background shows a busy, clean production floor with blurred motion of conveyors. The lighting is professional and industrial, highlighting the interplay between human expertise and machine complexity. No text or overlays in the image.",
