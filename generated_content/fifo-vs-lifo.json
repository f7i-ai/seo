In the foreground, a diverse team of two maintenance professionals (one man, one woman) are wearing clean, high-visibility vests, white hard hats, and safety glasses. They are standing near a neatly organized rack of industrial spare parts (motors and gearboxes). One professional is holding a rugged industrial tablet (showing only the back of the device), while the other is pointing toward a high-tech sensor mounted on a nearby machine. The background shows a clean, well-lit factory floor with a conveyor system. The lighting is bright and natural, conveying a sense of efficiency and advanced technology. No text or logos are visible on any surfaces. Full-body view of the professionals.",
