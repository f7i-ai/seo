  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a reliability engineer (wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-visibility vest) stands confidently, looking out over the production line. They are holding a tablet in their left hand, but the screen is not visible (back of tablet only). In the background, a diverse team of technicians in blue uniforms are working on a large, complex conveyor system and robotic arm. The lighting is a mix of cool industrial LED and warm highlights from the machinery. The atmosphere conveys efficiency, technology, and safety. There is no text or overlay in the image.",
