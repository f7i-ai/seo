  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-quality hero image of a modern Australian manufacturing facility. The scene features a diverse group of maintenance engineers and safety officers (men and women) wearing standard Australian PPE: hard hats, high-visibility yellow/orange vests with reflective strips, and safety glasses. One engineer is inspecting a large industrial motor or conveyor system, while another stands nearby holding a tablet (back of device visible only) referencing data. The environment is clean but industrial (brownfield style), with visible pipes, yellow safety walkways, and machinery. The lighting is professional and bright, emphasizing safety and technology. No text or overlays in the image.",
