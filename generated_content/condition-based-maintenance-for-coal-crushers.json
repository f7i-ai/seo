  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern industrial coal processing plant or power station. In the foreground, a reliability engineer wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, and high-visibility vest is inspecting a large, heavy-duty industrial coal crusher (machinery painted industrial yellow or blue). The engineer is holding a tablet (back of device visible only) and looking at a wireless vibration sensor magnetically attached to the bearing housing. The background shows conveyor belts, steel structures, and subtle atmospheric dust motes caught in shafts of light, emphasizing the harsh environment. The lighting is dramatic but professional, highlighting the technology and the scale of the machinery. No text or overlays.",
