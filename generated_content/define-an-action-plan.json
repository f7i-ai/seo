  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, photo-realistic wide shot of a modern industrial manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are standing near a large, well-maintained industrial motor and pump assembly. They are all wearing clean, professional PPE, including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility yellow vests. One technician is pointing toward a specific part of the machinery while the others look on, engaged in a collaborative discussion about an action plan. One technician is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet, but only the back of the device is visible to the camera. The background shows a clean, organized \"brownfield\" factory environment with overhead conveyors and various pipes, all bathed in bright, natural light from high factory windows. No text or logos are visible. Full-body shots of the people.",
