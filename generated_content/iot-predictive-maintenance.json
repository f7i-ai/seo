  "image_prompt": "A high-quality, photorealistic image of a female maintenance engineer of South Asian descent and a male operations manager of Caucasian descent standing on a clean, modern factory floor. They are both wearing safety glasses, high-visibility vests, and hard hats. The engineer is holding a ruggedized tablet displaying a screen with colorful charts and graphs, including a vibration waveform and a thermal heatmap. She is pointing to something on the screen, explaining it to the manager. In the background, slightly out of focus, is a large, modern industrial motor connected to a conveyor system. The lighting is bright and professional, creating a sense of high-tech efficiency and collaboration. The image should have a shallow depth of field to focus on the two people and the tablet. There should be no text on the image.",
