  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-resolution image of a diverse group of Australian maintenance technicians standing in a modern, clean manufacturing facility. They are wearing standard Australian PPE: high-visibility yellow and orange shirts with reflective strips, hard hats, safety glasses, and steel-capped boots. One technician in the foreground (seen from the back/side) is holding a tablet, pointing toward a large industrial conveyor motor. The tablet screen is not visible, but the posture suggests they are analyzing data. The background features blurred industrial machinery, conveying a sense of depth and activity. The lighting is bright and professional, highlighting the safety gear and the modern industrial setting. No text or words in the image.",
