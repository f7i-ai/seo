In the foreground, a reliability engineer (wearing a hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-visibility vest) is looking at a tablet held in their left hand (screen not visible to camera). Their right hand is gently resting near—but not touching—a large, industrial blue electric motor that has a small, futuristic-looking wireless sensor attached to the cooling fin. The background is slightly blurred, showing depth of the factory floor with yellow safety walkways and other machinery. The lighting is dramatic, highlighting the connection between the human, the machine, and the sensor. No text overlays. 16:9 aspect ratio.",
