  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, wide-angle shot inside a clean, modern manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse team of three maintenance professionals—a Hispanic male maintenance manager in his 40s with a tablet, a Black female reliability engineer in her 30s holding a vibration analysis tool, and a younger Asian male technician in his 20s—are gathered around a large industrial electric motor connected to a pump. They are all wearing appropriate PPE: safety glasses, hard hats, and high-visibility vests over their work uniforms. The manager is pointing to a graph on the tablet, which is displaying a real-time data trend. The engineer is pointing the vibration sensor at a bearing housing on the motor. The background is slightly out of focus but shows a well-lit, organized production line with advanced robotics. The overall mood is collaborative, professional, and high-tech.",
