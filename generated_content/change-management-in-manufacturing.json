  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance technicians (wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-vis vests) are gathered around a large industrial motor. One technician is pointing at a specific component, while another holds a ruggedized tablet (showing only the back/case, not the screen content) as if referencing data. They are engaged in a collaborative discussion, not a lecture. The background shows blurred production lines, yellow safety walkways, and soft industrial lighting. The atmosphere is professional, focused, and highlights teamwork and technology integration. No text or overlays.",
