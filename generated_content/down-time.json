  "image_prompt": "A wide-angle, photo-realistic shot of a modern, clean industrial manufacturing floor in 2026. In the foreground, a diverse team of three maintenance professionals (two men, one woman) are standing near a large, complex robotic assembly arm. They are all wearing full professional PPE: white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility orange vests over navy blue work uniforms. One technician is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet, but only the back of the device is visible to the camera. They are pointing toward a specific section of the machinery, engaged in a collaborative discussion. The lighting is bright and professional, highlighting the polished concrete floor and the intricate wiring and sensors attached to the machinery. No text or logos are visible. The focus is on the professional interaction and the high-tech environment.",
