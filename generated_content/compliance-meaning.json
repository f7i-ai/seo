  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-quality image set in a modern, clean industrial manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of two professionals (one male, one female) wearing standard PPE (hard hats, safety glasses, high-visibility vests). They are standing near a large, complex piece of industrial machinery. The female professional is holding a ruggedized tablet, but the screen is turned away from the camera (we see the back of the device). She is gesturing toward a specific component of the machine, while the male colleague looks on attentively, holding a digital testing tool. The background features blurred production lines with soft, professional lighting, conveying a sense of safety, organization, and high-tech efficiency. No text or words should appear in the image.",
