In the foreground, a female maintenance manager of South Asian descent and a male technician of Black descent are looking at a tablet together. They are both wearing safety glasses, hard hats, and high-visibility vests. The tablet screen is glowing, but the content is not visible. In the background, a large, complex piece of industrial equipment (like a CNC machine or a robotic arm) is visible but slightly out of focus.

The lighting is bright and professional, conveying a sense of high-tech competence and safety.",
