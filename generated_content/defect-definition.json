  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern yet active \"brownfield\" manufacturing facility. The lighting is a mix of natural light from high windows and cool industrial LED lighting. In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (one female, two male) are standing near a large industrial conveyor motor. They are wearing full PPE including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. The female engineer is holding a ruggedized tablet, but the screen is facing away from the camera. They are looking at the motor, where a small, wireless sensor is visibly attached. The background shows blurred motion of production lines, emphasizing a busy, working plant environment.
