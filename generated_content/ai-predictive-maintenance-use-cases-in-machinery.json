  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, professional image set in a bright, clean, modern manufacturing facility. A diverse team of three people—a Black woman, an East Asian man, and a Caucasian man—are collaborating. The woman is a maintenance manager pointing at a large, wall-mounted digital screen displaying complex machinery data: colorful vibration waveforms (FFT spectrums) and a thermal heatmap of a motor. The East Asian man, a data scientist, holds a tablet showing similar data. The Caucasian man, a senior technician, looks from the screen towards a large, pristine electric motor and pump assembly in the mid-ground. All are wearing appropriate PPE: hard hats, safety glasses, and professional work attire. The image conveys collaboration, high technology, and human expertise working together. The lighting is bright and optimistic, with a shallow depth of field focusing on the team and the screen. No text on the image.",
