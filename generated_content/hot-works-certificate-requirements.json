  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern industrial manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a safety supervisor (wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-visibility vest) is holding a ruggedized tablet, appearing to be checking off a digital list. The screen of the tablet is not visible to the viewer. In the mid-ground, slightly out of focus, a welder is preparing a workspace, wearing full welding leathers and a welding helmet (visor up), standing next to a large industrial pump. A bright red fire extinguisher is clearly visible and positioned correctly near the welder. The lighting is a mix of cool industrial LED and warm ambient light, highlighting the safety equipment. No text or words should be visible in the image.",
