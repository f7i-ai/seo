  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern industrial mineral processing plant or quarry. The focus is on a large, yellow industrial vibrating screen (mining equipment) in operation. A reliability engineer, wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, and high-visibility vest, is standing safely on a walkway next to the machine. They are holding a ruggedized tablet (back of tablet visible) and looking from the tablet to a wireless sensor mounted on the side plate of the vibrating screen. The lighting is dramatic but professional, highlighting the dust in the air and the motion of the machine. No text overlays. The image conveys technology meeting heavy industry.",
