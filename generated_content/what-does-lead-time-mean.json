  "image_prompt": "A professional, photo-realistic wide shot of a modern but established (brownfield) manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals—two men and one woman—are standing near a large industrial motor and pump assembly. They are wearing full PPE, including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One technician is pointing toward a sensor mounted on the motor, while another holds a ruggedized tablet (shown from the back, no screen visible). The lighting is bright and industrial, highlighting the clean but used nature of the machinery. The background shows a blur of conveyors and other plant equipment, conveying a sense of scale and activity. No text or logos are visible on the equipment or clothing.",
