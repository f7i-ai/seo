In the foreground, a diverse pair of maintenance professionals (one male, one female) are collaborating. They are wearing clean, professional PPE including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One professional is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet (showing only the back of the device), while the other is pointing toward a large, well-maintained industrial motor assembly. The background shows a clean, organized \"brownfield\" factory setting with a mix of legacy machinery and modern sensor wiring. The lighting is bright and professional, emphasizing a culture of safety and high-tech reliability. No text or logos are visible on the equipment or clothing. Full-body or waist-up view.",
