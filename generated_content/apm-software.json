  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, professional hero image of a modern industrial manufacturing floor. In the foreground, a diverse team of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are collaborating. They are wearing clean, professional PPE: white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility yellow vests over work shirts. One technician is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet, but only the back of the device is visible to the camera. They are standing near a large, well-maintained industrial pump and motor assembly that has small, unobtrusive wireless sensors attached to it. The background shows a clean, brightly lit factory with automated conveyor lines and stainless steel machinery. The lighting is natural and bright, conveying a sense of high-tech efficiency and safety. No text or words are visible in the image. Full body or waist-up shot.",
