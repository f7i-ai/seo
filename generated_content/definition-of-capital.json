  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, professional photo of a diverse team of three industrial professionals—a maintenance manager, a female plant engineer, and a senior technician—standing in a clean, modern manufacturing facility. They are wearing full PPE, including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility neon vests. The maintenance manager is holding a rugged industrial tablet (viewed from the back, no screen visible) while they all look toward a large, complex piece of industrial machinery (a robotic assembly arm or a large compressor) in the background. The lighting is bright and cinematic, emphasizing a \"brownfield-modern\" aesthetic where clean, new technology integrates with established industrial infrastructure. Full-body shot, no text or logos visible.",
