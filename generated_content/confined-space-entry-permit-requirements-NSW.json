  "image_prompt": "A hyper-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern industrial manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance technicians (men and women) are gathered near a large industrial storage tank. They are wearing full PPE: hard hats, safety glasses, high-visibility vests with reflective strips, and safety gloves. One technician is holding a rugged tablet (back of device visible only) while another points to a digital lockout/tagout lock on a valve. In the background, blurred slightly, are conveyor belts and heavy machinery. The lighting is a mix of cool industrial LED and warm amber safety lights. No text or words should be visible in the image. The atmosphere conveys professionalism, safety, and high-tech efficiency.",
