  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, professional image set in a clean, modern factory control room. A diverse team of three people—a middle-aged Caucasian male maintenance manager in a hard hat, a young Asian female engineer in safety glasses, and a Black male technician in his 30s wearing a high-visibility vest—are gathered around a large industrial tablet held by the manager. The manager is pointing at the screen, which displays complex graphs and a 3D model of a machine (no text visible). The engineer is looking thoughtfully at the screen, and the technician is looking over her shoulder towards a large pump and motor assembly visible in the background through a window. The lighting is bright and professional, with a slightly shallow depth of field that keeps the focus on the collaborative team and the technology. The overall mood is proactive, data-driven, and technologically advanced.",
