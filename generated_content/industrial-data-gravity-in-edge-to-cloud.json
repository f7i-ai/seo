  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern, high-tech manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers and OT architects (wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests) are gathered around a large industrial pump and motor assembly. One engineer is pointing at a ruggedized edge gateway device mounted on the motor, while another holds a tablet (back of tablet visible only) showing a data visualization. In the background, blurred slightly, are automated conveyor lines and robotic arms. The lighting is a mix of cool industrial LED and warm accent lighting on the machinery, emphasizing a clean, futuristic \"Industry 4.0\" atmosphere. No text or overlays. The image should convey technical collaboration and advanced technology.",
