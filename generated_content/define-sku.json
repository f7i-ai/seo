  "image_prompt": "A professional, photo-realistic wide shot of a modern, well-organized industrial maintenance warehouse. In the foreground, a diverse team of two maintenance professionals (one male, one female) are collaborating. They are wearing clean, high-visibility vests, white hard hats, and safety glasses. One person is pointing toward a neatly labeled shelf of spare parts (motors and bearings), while the other holds a rugged industrial tablet (showing only the back of the device). The warehouse features high ceilings, bright LED lighting, and clearly marked floor lanes. The atmosphere is efficient and high-tech. No text or logos are visible on the equipment or shelving. Full-body view of the professionals.",
