The sensor has a small glowing LED indicating data transmission. In the background, a maintenance engineer in PPE is looking at a tablet displaying a clear, green-and-amber frequency spectrum graph (FFT). The environment is clean but clearly industrial, with pipes and steel structures. Photo-realistic, cinematic lighting, 8k resolution.",
