  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern Australian manufacturing facility. The scene features a diverse group of maintenance engineers and plant managers (men and women) wearing standard high-visibility vests, hard hats, and safety glasses. They are standing near a large industrial conveyor belt system and a series of heavy motors. One engineer is holding a tablet (back of device visible only) pointing toward a machine, implying data scanning. The lighting is professional and industrial, with a mix of cool blue ambient light and warm task lighting. The facility looks \"brownfield\" but clean—a mix of older heavy machinery fitted with modern, small wireless sensors. No text or words should be visible in the image.",
