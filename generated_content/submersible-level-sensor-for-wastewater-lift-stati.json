  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-quality image inside a modern industrial wastewater treatment facility or lift station environment. In the foreground, a maintenance technician wearing a hard hat, safety glasses, and high-visibility vest is inspecting a stainless steel submersible level sensor held by its cable (the sensor head is visible, showing a flush diaphragm). The background shows piping, valves, and a control panel with indicator lights. The lighting is industrial but dramatic, highlighting the sensor. No text or overlays. The technician is viewed from the side or 3/4 angle, focusing on the equipment inspection.",
