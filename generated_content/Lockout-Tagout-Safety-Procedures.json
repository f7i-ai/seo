  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-quality image set in a modern industrial manufacturing facility. The focus is on a diverse group of maintenance technicians wearing full PPE (hard hats, safety glasses, high-visibility vests, and gloves). In the foreground, a technician is physically applying a red safety padlock and a warning tag to a large, industrial yellow ball valve lockout device on a pipe. Another technician stands slightly behind, holding a tablet (showing only the back of the device) to reference a digital checklist. The background features blurred industrial machinery, conveying a sense of a busy but organized factory floor. The lighting is bright and professional, highlighting the safety equipment. No text or words should be visible in the image.",
