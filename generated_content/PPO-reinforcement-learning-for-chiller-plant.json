In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers and data scientists (wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and reflective vests) are examining a tablet (screen hidden) and gesturing towards a digital overlay or holographic projection near the equipment that implies data flow or digital twin technology. The lighting is professional, cool-toned industrial LED, emphasizing a clean, modern facility. No text or words in the image.",
