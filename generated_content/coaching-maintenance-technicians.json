  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern, clean manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse pair of maintenance technicians are standing in front of a complex industrial conveyor system. One is an older, experienced technician (wearing a hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-visibility vest) pointing at a specific component of the machine, explaining it. The other is a younger technician, listening intently and holding a rugged tablet (back of tablet visible) to reference data. The background is slightly blurred but shows active production lines and yellow safety barriers. The lighting is professional industrial lighting, highlighting the focus and collaboration between the two. No text in the image. Atmosphere conveys professionalism, mentorship, and technology integration.",
