  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, high-detail 8k image for a blog post hero image. A female reliability engineer of Hispanic descent and a male maintenance manager of Black descent are standing in a clean, modern manufacturing facility. They are looking together at a ruggedized tablet which displays a colorful vibration analysis FFT spectrum and a thermal image of a motor. In the background, a large, clean industrial electric motor is clearly visible but slightly out of focus. Both individuals are wearing safety glasses, hard hats, and professional work attire. The lighting is bright and cinematic, highlighting the technology and the collaborative, data-driven nature of their work. The image should be free of any text or logos.",
