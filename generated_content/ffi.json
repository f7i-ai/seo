In the foreground, a reliability engineer wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, and high-visibility vest is inspecting a complex pressure relief valve assembly. The engineer is holding a tablet (back of tablet visible) to check a checklist. In the background, blurred but visible, are large piping systems and another technician walking in the distance. The lighting is professional and industrial, highlighting the metallic textures of the valve and the seriousness of the safety inspection. No text or overlays.",
