  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern industrial manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a safety officer wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-visibility vest is holding a tablet (back of tablet visible, no screen content). They are inspecting a welding zone. In the mid-ground, a welder in full protective gear (welding helmet down, leather jacket, gloves) is working on a large metal pipe structure. Sparks are flying but contained. A second person (Fire Watch) is standing nearby, attentive, holding a fire extinguisher, wearing safety gear. The background shows blurred industrial machinery and yellow safety barriers. The lighting is dramatic, highlighting the sparks and the safety officer's inspection. No text in the image.",
