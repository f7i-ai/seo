In the foreground, a diverse group of three professionals—a maintenance manager in a white hard hat and high-visibility vest, and two technicians in blue coveralls and safety glasses—are standing around a large industrial motor on a workbench. One technician is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet (showing only the back of the device). In the background, high-density automated storage and retrieval systems (ASRS) are visible, with robotic shuttles moving along shelves. The environment is clean, organized, and represents a high-tech 2026 manufacturing setting. The lighting is natural and clear, emphasizing a professional and efficient atmosphere. No text or screens are visible.",
