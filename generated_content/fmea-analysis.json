  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a reliability engineer wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-visibility vest is inspecting a large industrial electric motor connected to a conveyor belt. The engineer is looking intently at the machinery, not at a screen. In the background, slightly out of focus, another technician in blue coveralls is working on a pump system. The lighting is industrial but warm, highlighting the texture of the metal equipment. Small, unobtrusive wireless sensors are visible mounted on the motor fins. No text or holographic overlays in the image. The atmosphere conveys professionalism, safety, and advanced technology integration in a brownfield setting.",
