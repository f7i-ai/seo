In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance engineers (men and women) wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests are inspecting a large industrial electric motor. One engineer is holding a tablet (back of device visible only) pointing toward the machine, implying data scanning. In the background, blurred but visible, are conveyor belts and automated machinery.
