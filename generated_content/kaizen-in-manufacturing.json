  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot of a modern manufacturing facility floor. In the foreground, a diverse group of three industrial professionals (one female engineer, two male technicians) are wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. They are standing near a large industrial conveyor belt system. The female engineer is holding a generic industrial tablet (back of device facing camera, no screen visible), pointing toward a specific motor on the conveyor. The lighting is professional and bright, highlighting the clean, organized nature of the facility. The background shows blurred motion of machinery, implying productivity. No text or logos should be visible in the image. The atmosphere conveys collaboration, technology, and efficiency.",
