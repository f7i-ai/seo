  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, high-quality image inside a modern manufacturing facility. The focus is on a reliability engineer (wearing a hard hat, safety glasses, and high-vis vest) standing in front of a large industrial pump system. The engineer is holding a tablet (back of tablet visible) and appears to be scanning a QR code tag attached to the machinery. In the background, blurred slightly, are other diverse technicians working on a conveyor line. The lighting is industrial but bright, highlighting the clean metallic surfaces of the equipment. No text overlays. The image should convey precision, technology, and industrial scale.",
