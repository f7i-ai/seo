  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a reliability engineer (wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-visibility vest) is looking at a tablet held in their left hand (back of tablet visible only). They are standing next to a large industrial electric motor connected to a conveyor belt system. In the background, slightly out of focus, another technician in blue coveralls is inspecting a pump. The lighting is a mix of cool industrial LED and warm ambient light, highlighting the metallic textures of the machinery. No text or screens visible. The atmosphere conveys high-tech efficiency and safety.",
