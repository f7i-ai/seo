  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern, clean manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers and maintenance technicians (men and women) are gathered around a large industrial pump system. They are wearing standard PPE (hard hats, safety glasses, high-vis vests). One technician is holding a ruggedized tablet, showing the back of the device to the camera (screen hidden), while pointing at a specific component on the machine. Another engineer is holding a vibration analysis sensor. The background features blurred automated conveyor lines and soft, cool industrial lighting. The atmosphere is professional, collaborative, and focused on technology-driven maintenance. No text or overlays.",
