  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern, high-tech manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of professionals is gathered around a large, complex piece of industrial machinery (like a turbine or automated assembly arm). One person is a maintenance manager wearing a hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-visibility vest, pointing at a specific component of the machine. Next to them is a professional in business casual attire (representing a CFO or finance director) also wearing safety glasses, looking intently at the machine while holding a tablet (back of tablet visible only). In the background, blurred slightly, are other technicians working and automated conveyors moving. The lighting is a mix of cool industrial LED and warm accent lighting from the machinery interfaces. The image conveys collaboration between operations and finance. No text or words in the image.",
