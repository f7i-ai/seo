  "image_prompt": "A professional, photo-realistic wide shot of a modern industrial manufacturing floor in 2026. In the foreground, a diverse team of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are inspecting a large, high-efficiency electromagnetic induction motor. They are wearing full PPE: white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility orange vests. One technician is kneeling near the motor's conduit box, while another holds a professional handheld industrial diagnostic tool (showing only the back of the device). The third technician is pointing toward the motor's cooling fins. The environment is clean, well-lit, and features other industrial machinery like pumps and conveyors in the blurred background. No text or logos are visible. Full-body view of the professionals.",
