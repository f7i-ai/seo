In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers (men and women) are wearing orange flame-resistant coveralls, hard hats, and safety glasses. One engineer is inspecting a large centrifugal pump, holding a tablet (back of device visible only). In the background, the complex piping and distillation columns of the refinery are illuminated by industrial lighting, with steam rising softly. The image conveys high-tech industrial efficiency and safety. No text overlays. 8k resolution.",
