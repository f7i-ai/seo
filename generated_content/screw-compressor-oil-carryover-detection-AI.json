  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern, clean industrial compressor room. In the foreground, a reliability engineer (wearing a hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-vis vest) is inspecting a large rotary screw compressor. The engineer is holding a tablet (screen not visible) and looking at a specific section of the compressor piping (the scavenge line area). In the background, soft-focus digital overlays (subtle, glowing blue lines or data nodes) hover near the equipment, symbolizing the \"digital twin\" or AI monitoring aspect, but kept realistic and not cartoony. The lighting is industrial but warm, highlighting the metallic textures of the compressor and the professionalism of the worker. 8k resolution, high detail.",
