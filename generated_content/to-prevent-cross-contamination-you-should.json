In the foreground, two diverse maintenance technicians (one male, one female) are standing near a stainless steel conveyor system. They are wearing full PPE: white lab coats, hairnets, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One technician is holding a professional-grade, ruggedized tablet (showing only the back of the device). In the background, the facility is brightly lit, exceptionally clean, and features color-coded zones (indicated by a clear red line on the floor). There are organized shadow boards with color-coded tools visible on the wall. The atmosphere is one of precision, cleanliness, and advanced technology. No text or logos are visible. Full-body shots of the technicians.",
