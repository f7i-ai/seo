  "image_prompt": "A wide-angle, photo-realistic shot of a modern, high-speed beverage packaging line in a clean, well-lit industrial facility. In the foreground, a diverse team of three maintenance professionals (two men, one woman) are conducting a collaborative inspection. They are wearing full professional PPE: white hard hats, clear safety glasses, high-visibility vests over blue work uniforms, and steel-toed boots. One technician is kneeling to examine a conveyor motor assembly, while the other two stand nearby, one holding a ruggedized industrial tablet (showing only the back of the device). The background shows a gleaming stainless steel rotary filler and a series of conveyors with green glass bottles moving through the system. The lighting is bright and clinical, emphasizing a high-tech, \"Industry 4.0\" atmosphere. No text or digital displays are visible. Full-body shots of the professionals.",
