  "image_prompt": "A wide-angle, photo-realistic shot of a modern 2026 smart factory floor. In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (one woman in a white hard hat, two men in yellow high-visibility vests) are standing near a large industrial compressor. They are wearing full PPE, including safety glasses and gloves. One technician is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet, but we only see the back of the device, which features a reinforced casing. In the background, the facility is clean and well-lit, with robotic arms and conveyor belts visible. Small, unobtrusive LED-lit IoT sensors are attached to various machines. The lighting is natural and bright, emphasizing a high-tech yet human-centric industrial environment. No text or digital overlays are visible in the image. Full body shots of the professionals.",
