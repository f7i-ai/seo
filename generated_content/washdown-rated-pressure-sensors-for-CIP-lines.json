  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-resolution image inside a modern, stainless-steel heavy food processing facility or pharmaceutical plant. In the foreground, a reliability engineer (wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, and a clean manufacturing uniform) is inspecting a shiny, stainless steel pressure sensor mounted on a complex piping manifold. The sensor has an illuminated LED ring indicating status. In the background, slightly out of focus, another technician in full PPE is performing a washdown of a tank using a spray hose, illustrating the harsh environment. The lighting is bright, clinical, and industrial cool-toned. No text or overlays. Show the \"drip loop\" in the cabling clearly if possible.",
