  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-resolution image inside a modern, clean Australian manufacturing warehouse. In the center, a yellow industrial scissor lift is elevated slightly. A diverse group of maintenance technicians and operators (men and women) are conducting an inspection. They are wearing full PPE: hard hats, high-visibility vests with reflective strips, steel-toed boots, and safety glasses. One technician is holding a tablet (back of device visible only) appearing to use an app, while pointing at the hydraulic mechanism of the lift. The background shows blurred industrial machinery and organized racking. The lighting is bright and professional. No text or overlays in the image.",
