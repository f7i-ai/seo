  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-resolution image inside a modern manufacturing facility in Victoria, Australia. The scene features a diverse group of maintenance technicians and a facility manager. They are wearing standard Australian PPE: high-visibility yellow and orange vests with reflective strips, hard hats, safety glasses, and steel-capped boots. The facility manager is holding a tablet (back of device visible only) pointing toward a large industrial conveyor belt system. In the background, blurred slightly, are large industrial pumps and yellow safety guarding. The lighting is bright and industrial. The atmosphere is professional and focused on safety inspection. No text or words should be visible in the image.",
