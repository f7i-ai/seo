In the foreground, a diverse maintenance technician (wearing a hard hat, safety glasses, and high-visibility vest) is inspecting a large industrial electric motor. The technician is looking at a tablet held in their hand (screen not visible to camera), while pointing a wireless vibration sensor attached to the cooling fins of the motor.
