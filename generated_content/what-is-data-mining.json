  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, high-resolution hero image set inside a modern manufacturing facility. The scene features a diverse group of reliability engineers and maintenance technicians (men and women of various ethnicities) wearing standard PPE including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. They are standing near a large industrial conveyor system and a heavy-duty motor. One technician is holding a tablet, but only the back of the device is visible (no screen text). In the background, there is a subtle visual representation of digital data streams or a \"digital twin\" wireframe overlaying a section of the machinery, symbolizing data mining, but it should look integrated and professional, not cartoonish. The lighting is industrial but warm, highlighting the cleanliness and high-tech nature of the modern factory. No text or words should appear in the image.",
