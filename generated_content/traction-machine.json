  "image_prompt": "A high-end, photo-realistic hero image of a modern industrial elevator machine room. In the center, a large, sleek gearless traction machine (PMSM) with a bright orange drive sheave and steel hoist ropes is the focus. Two maintenance professionals—one man and one woman of diverse backgrounds—are performing a routine inspection. They are wearing clean, professional PPE including white hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One technician is standing near the machine, while the other is holding a ruggedized tablet (showing only the back of the device). The environment is clean, well-lit, and represents a state-of-the-art 2026 facility. Full body shots, no text, professional architectural photography style.",
