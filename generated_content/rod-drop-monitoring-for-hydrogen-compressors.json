  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern, high-tech industrial hydrogen compression facility. The lighting is cool and clean, emphasizing a \"future energy\" aesthetic with subtle blue LED accents on machinery. In the foreground, a diverse team of two reliability engineers (one male, one female) wearing full PPE (white hard hats, safety glasses, high-visibility vests over blue coveralls) are inspecting a large, horizontal reciprocating compressor. The female engineer is pointing at a sensor mounted on the compressor's packing case (an eddy current probe location), while the male engineer holds a rugged industrial tablet (back of tablet facing camera) referencing data. The background shows complex piping, pressure vessels, and digital monitoring displays. No text in the image. High resolution, 8k.",
