  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-quality hero image of a modern Australian mining maintenance environment. The scene features a diverse group of maintenance professionals (men and women) wearing standard Australian mining PPE: high-visibility orange and navy shirts with reflective strips, hard hats, and safety glasses. One engineer is inspecting a large conveyor motor, holding a tablet (back of device visible only) to check data. In the background, there is heavy processing equipment, such as a crusher or ball mill, with yellow safety railings. The lighting is industrial but bright, suggesting a clean, well-managed, and compliant facility. No text or overlays in the image.",
