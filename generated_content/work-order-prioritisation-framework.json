In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance professionals (a man and a woman) wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests are looking at a tablet held by the woman (we see the back of the tablet, not the screen). They are standing in front of a large, complex industrial machine with pipes and sensors. The background is slightly blurred but shows depth of the factory floor with yellow safety lines. The lighting is professional and industrial, highlighting the seriousness and focus of the team. No text or overlays.",
