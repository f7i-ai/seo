  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-resolution image of a modern manufacturing facility floor. In the foreground, a diverse team of maintenance technicians (wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests) are inspecting a large, orange industrial robotic arm. One technician is pointing at the \"elbow\" joint of the robot, while another holds a tablet (showing only the back of the device) to reference data. The background is slightly blurred but shows other robotic cells in operation, conveying a busy, high-tech production environment. The lighting is bright and industrial, highlighting the clean lines of the machinery and the professionalism of the team. No text or overlays.",
