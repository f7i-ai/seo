  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-quality image of a modern industrial maintenance environment. In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance technicians (men and women) wearing safety gear (hard hats, safety glasses, high-vis vests) are gathered around a large industrial pump or motor. One technician is pointing to a specific component, while another holds a tablet (showing the back of the device, not the screen) appearing to log data or check a schematic. The background is a clean, well-lit manufacturing facility with blurred machinery and yellow safety lines on the floor. The lighting should be professional and dynamic, highlighting the teamwork and focus on the equipment. No text or words in the image.",
