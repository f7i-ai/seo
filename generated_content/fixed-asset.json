  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, photo-realistic wide shot of a modern, clean industrial manufacturing floor. In the foreground, a diverse pair of professionals—a female maintenance manager in a white hard hat and high-visibility vest and a male financial controller in a blue hard hat and safety glasses—are standing next to a large, complex industrial robotic arm (a fixed asset). They are looking at the machine and discussing its condition. The maintenance manager is pointing at a specific component of the robot. Both are wearing appropriate PPE, including safety glasses and steel-toed boots. The background shows other well-maintained machinery and a clean, organized workspace. No digital screens or tablet displays are visible; the focus is on the human interaction and the physical asset. The lighting is bright and professional, typical of a modern facility.",
