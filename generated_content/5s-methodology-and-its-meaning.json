  "image_prompt": "A hyper-realistic, professional wide shot of a modern manufacturing facility floor. The scene features a diverse group of maintenance technicians and operators (men and women of various ethnicities) wearing standard PPE including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. They are engaged in a \"Gemba walk,\" observing a large industrial conveyor system. One technician in the foreground is holding a rugged tablet, but only the back of the device is visible (no screen content). The environment is clean and well-organized, reflecting the 5S methodology, with clear floor markings and shadow boards visible in the background. The lighting is bright and industrial. No text or words should appear in the image. The atmosphere conveys efficiency, safety, and modern technology integration.",
