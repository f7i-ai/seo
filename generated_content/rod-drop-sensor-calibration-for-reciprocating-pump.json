  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-resolution image inside a modern industrial petrochemical facility. In the foreground, a reliability engineer wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, and blue FR (fire-resistant) coveralls is inspecting a large horizontal reciprocating pump. The engineer is holding a multimeter probe near the packing case of the pump, focused on a proximity sensor installation. The background shows the complexity of the piping and machinery, slightly blurred to emphasize the technician. The lighting is industrial but warm, highlighting the metallic textures of the pump and the seriousness of the maintenance task. No text overlays. The engineer is viewed from the side/back, looking at the equipment.",
