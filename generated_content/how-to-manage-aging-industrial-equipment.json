  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, high-quality image set in a clean, modern manufacturing facility. A female maintenance manager of Hispanic descent and a male reliability engineer of Asian descent, both in their 30s-40s and wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests, are standing in front of a large, slightly older piece of industrial machinery (like a stamping press or a CNC machine). The manager is holding a ruggedized tablet that displays colorful graphs and data analytics. They are both looking at the tablet and pointing towards the machine, engaged in a collaborative discussion. The lighting is bright and professional, highlighting the contrast between the modern technology (the tablet) and the legacy equipment. The background is slightly blurred to keep the focus on the people and the machine. There is no text on the image.",
