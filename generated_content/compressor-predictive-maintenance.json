  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, professional image set in a clean, modern manufacturing plant. A female maintenance manager of Hispanic descent with her hair in a bun and a male reliability engineer of East Asian descent are standing side-by-side, looking at a tablet the engineer is holding. They are both wearing safety glasses and professional work attire. The tablet screen shows colorful graphs and data analytics. In the background, slightly out of focus, is a large, modern industrial screw air compressor. A small, glowing blue IIoT sensor is visibly mounted on the compressor's motor housing. The lighting is bright and clean, emphasizing a high-tech, efficient environment. The image should be free of any text or logos.",
