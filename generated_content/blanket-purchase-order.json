They are wearing clean, professional PPE including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility vests over navy blue work shirts. One person is holding a rugged industrial tablet (back of the device visible), pointing toward a neatly organized shelf of MRO components like bearings and motors in the background.

The focus is on the professional collaboration and the organized inventory environment. Full body shots showing the scale of the industrial facility.",
