  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, photo-realistic hero image of a modern industrial manufacturing floor. In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are standing near a large industrial motor and pump assembly. They are all wearing full PPE, including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility orange vests. One technician is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet, but only the back of the device is visible to the camera. They are pointing toward the machinery, engaged in a professional discussion about asset health. The background shows a clean, well-lit factory environment with various pipes and conveyors, slightly blurred to maintain focus on the team. No text or logos are visible on the equipment or clothing. Full-body shots of the professionals.",
