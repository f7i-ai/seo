  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern, high-tech manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance engineers (men and women) wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests are gathered around a large industrial turbine. One engineer is pointing at a specific component of the machine, while another holds a tablet (showing only the back of the device) as if referencing data. The background is slightly blurred but shows automated conveyor belts and clean, metallic industrial architecture with cool blue and warm amber lighting. The atmosphere is professional, collaborative, and focused on technology. No text or words in the image.",
