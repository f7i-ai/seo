  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, photo-realistic hero image of a modern industrial facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (two men, one woman) are collaborating. They are wearing clean, professional PPE: white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility orange vests over work shirts. One technician is pointing toward a large, well-maintained industrial traction motor and drive sheave system in the mid-ground. Another technician is holding a ruggedized tablet, showing only the back of the device. The environment is a \"brownfield\" plant that has been modernized—clean floors, organized cable runs, and clear safety markings. The lighting is bright and professional, emphasizing a sense of high-tech reliability and safety. No text or logos are visible on the equipment or clothing. Full-body shots of the professionals.",
