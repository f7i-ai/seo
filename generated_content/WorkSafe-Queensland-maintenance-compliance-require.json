  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern Queensland manufacturing facility. The scene features a diverse group of maintenance technicians and a safety manager wearing standard Australian PPE (high-vis yellow vests with reflective strips, hard hats, safety glasses, and steel-capped boots). They are standing near a large industrial conveyor belt system. One technician is holding a tablet (back of device visible only) pointing it toward a motor, implying a digital inspection. The lighting is industrial but warm, highlighting the cleanliness and organization of the plant. No text or words should be visible in the image.
