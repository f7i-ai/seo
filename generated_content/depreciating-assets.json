  "image_prompt": "A wide-angle, photo-realistic shot of a modern, clean industrial manufacturing floor in 2026. In the foreground, a diverse team of three professionals—a female maintenance manager in a white hard hat and high-visibility vest, and two technicians in blue jumpsuits and safety glasses—are standing near a large, complex robotic assembly arm. One technician is pointing toward a specific joint on the machine while holding a ruggedized tablet (back of the device visible). The lighting is bright and professional, highlighting the polished concrete floors and the high-tech machinery. All personnel are wearing appropriate PPE, including hard hats and safety glasses. The background shows other well-maintained machinery and a digital dashboard on a distant wall showing green performance metrics. No text or displays are visible on the handheld devices. Full-body view of the team.",
