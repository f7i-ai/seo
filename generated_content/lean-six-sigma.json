  "image_prompt": "A wide-angle, photo-realistic shot of a modern industrial manufacturing floor. In the foreground, a diverse group of three professionals (two men, one woman) are standing near a large, well-maintained piece of machinery. They are wearing appropriate PPE, including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility yellow vests over professional work clothes. One person is pointing toward a section of the machine while the others observe. One person is holding a ruggedized tablet, but only the back of the device is visible to the camera. The background shows a clean, organized plant environment with clear floor markings, reflecting the 5S methodology. The lighting is bright and natural, suggesting a high-tech, efficient atmosphere. No text or logos are visible on the equipment or clothing. Full-body shots of the individuals.",
