  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, professional photo of a diverse maintenance team (one man, one woman) performing an ultrasonic inspection on a large industrial pressure vessel in a clean, modern manufacturing facility. The technicians are wearing full PPE, including white hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One technician is holding a professional handheld ultrasonic transducer against the side of a large steel pipe, while the other is looking at a ruggedized tablet (back of the tablet shown). The lighting is bright and industrial, highlighting the metallic textures of the machinery. No text or screens are visible. Full-body shot showing the scale of the industrial equipment.\n\n***\n\n**References:**\n*   American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).
