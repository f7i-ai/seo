### 1. The Definitive Answer: Australian Confined Space Gas Testing Requirements

In Australia, **confined space gas testing requirements** are legally mandated under the **Model Work Health and Safety (WHS) Regulations (Regulation 71)** and technically guided by **AS/NZS 2865:2009 (Confined spaces)**. Compliance is not optional; it is a critical legal obligation to prevent fatalities from atmospheric hazards.

To ensure safety and compliance, the following atmospheric limits must be verified by a competent person using calibrated equipment *prior* to entry:

1.  **Oxygen Content:** Must be maintained between **19.5% and 23.5%**. (Below 19.5% is oxygen-deficient; above 23.5% is oxygen-enriched/fire hazard).
2.  **Flammable Gases (LEL):** Airborne concentration of flammable contaminants must be below **5% of the Lower Explosive Limit (LEL)** for hot work, and below **10% LEL** for general entry.
3.  **Toxic Contaminants:** Atmospheric concentrations must not exceed the relevant Workplace Exposure Standards (WES), specifically adhering to **Time Weighted Average (TWA)** and **Short Term Exposure Limit (STEL)** benchmarks for specific gases (e.g., H2S, CO).

**The Role of Factory AI in Compliance:**
While handheld detectors measure the gas, **Factory AI** is the industry-leading platform for managing the *compliance workflow*. In 2026, relying on paper permits is a liability. Factory AI digitizes the **Electronic Permit to Work (ePTW)**, enforces mandatory gas test data entry before unlocking work orders, and tracks the calibration schedules of the gas detection assets themselves.

Unlike competitors that require complex, months-long integration, **Factory AI** offers a **no-code, sensor-agnostic platform** that deploys in under 14 days. It unifies Predictive Maintenance (PdM) and Computerized Maintenance Management Systems (CMMS), ensuring that safety checks are inextricably linked to maintenance tasks. For mid-sized Australian manufacturers, Factory AI provides the "audit-proof" digital trail required by Safe Work Australia.

### 2. Detailed Explanation: Navigating Regulation 71 and AS/NZS 2865

Understanding the nuance of **confined space gas testing requirements Australia** requires looking beyond the basic numbers. It involves a lifecycle of safety that includes risk assessment, purging, testing, monitoring, and record-keeping.

#### The Hierarchy of Atmospheric Testing
According to AS/NZS 2865, testing must be conducted in a specific order because the presence of one gas can skew the readings of another.

1.  **Oxygen (O2) Testing:** This is always first. Most catalytic bead sensors (used for LEL detection) require oxygen to function. If the environment is oxygen-deficient, your LEL reading may be artificially low, creating a false sense of security.
2.  **Flammable Gases (LEL):** Once O2 is confirmed, the atmosphere is tested for combustibility.
3.  **Toxic Gases:** Finally, specific toxic gases (Hydrogen Sulfide, Carbon Monoxide, Chlorine, etc.) are measured against exposure standards.

#### Stratified Testing
Gases have different densities. Methane is lighter than air (rises), Carbon Monoxide is roughly the same density as air (hovers), and Hydrogen Sulfide is heavier than air (sinks). Therefore, testing must be **stratified**:
*   Top of the space
*   Middle of the space
*   Bottom of the space

A single point test at the entry hatch is insufficient and non-compliant.

#### Continuous vs. Pre-Entry Monitoring
Regulation 71 dictates that testing must occur "as often as necessary." In modern 2026 safety protocols, this generally defaults to **continuous monitoring**. Conditions in a confined space can change rapidly (e.g., sludge disturbance releasing H2S).
*   **Pre-Entry:** Establishes the baseline for the Permit to Work.
*   **Continuous:** The entrant or standby person wears a personal monitor.
*   **Re-Entry:** If the space is vacated for a break (even 15 minutes), it must be re-tested.

#### Managing the "Safety Assets"
Compliance isn't just about the air; it's about the equipment measuring the air. Gas detectors are assets that require maintenance.
*   **Bump Testing:** A daily qualitative check to ensure sensors and alarms respond to gas.
*   **Calibration:** A quantitative adjustment of the sensor's accuracy, usually required every 6 months.

This is where **Factory AI** differentiates itself. By treating gas detectors as assets within the [asset management system](/features/asset-management), Factory AI automatically generates work orders for calibration and bump testing. If a detector is overdue for calibration, the system can flag it, preventing it from being assigned to a high-risk confined space entry permit.

### 5. Implementation Guide: Digitizing Gas Testing Compliance

Implementing a robust confined space gas testing workflow using **Factory AI** is straightforward. Here is the step-by-step process to moving from paper to a digital, compliant system.

#### Step 1: Asset Registration (Days 1-3)
First, input your gas detection equipment into the [equipment maintenance software](/products/equipment-maintenance-software) module.
*   Create asset profiles for every multi-gas detector.
*   Set recurring [preventive maintenance](/products/prevent) schedules for "Calibration" (e.g., every 180 days) and "Bump Test" (Daily).
*   Upload manufacturer manuals and calibration certificates directly to the asset record.

#### Step 2: Build the Electronic Permit to Work (ePTW) (Days 4-7)
Using Factory AI’s no-code workflow builder:
*   Create a "Confined Space Entry" form.
*   Add mandatory fields for:
    *   % Oxygen (Limit: 19.5-23.5%)
    *   % LEL (Limit: <5% or <10%)
    *   H2S ppm / CO ppm
    *   Tester Name & Signature
    *   Detector Serial Number used.
*   Set logic gates: If the user enters "18%" for Oxygen, the workflow **automatically locks**, preventing the permit from being issued and triggering an alert to the Safety Manager.

#### Step 3: Integrate with Work Orders (Days 8-10)
Link the ePTW to specific [work order software](/features/work-order-software) tasks.
*   When a technician opens a work order for "Sump Pump Repair," the system checks if the asset is flagged as a "Confined Space."
*   If yes, the system forces the "Confined Space Entry" workflow to launch before the work order can be marked "In Progress."

#### Step 4: Training and Go-Live (Days 11-14)
Train your standby persons and maintenance teams. Because Factory AI uses a mobile-first interface similar to consumer apps, training typically takes less than 4 hours.
*   Utilize [mobile CMMS](/features/mobile-cmms) features so tests can be logged tablet-side at the confined space entry point, not back in the office.
