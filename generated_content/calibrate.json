In the foreground, a reliability technician wearing safety glasses, a hard hat, and high-visibility vest is focused on a digital pressure transmitter connected to a complex piping system. The technician is holding a yellow, ruggedized multifunction process calibrator (back of device visible, no screen text). The background shows blurred automated machinery and blue-toned industrial lighting, conveying a high-tech, 2026 manufacturing environment. The image should convey precision, focus, and industrial safety. No text or words in the image.",
