  "image_prompt": "A wide-angle, photo-realistic shot of a modern 2026 smart factory floor. In the foreground, a diverse team of three professionals—a woman in a white hard hat and high-visibility vest, and two men in blue industrial workwear and safety glasses—are standing near a large, clean, high-tech robotic assembly line. They are engaged in a professional discussion. One person is holding a rugged industrial tablet, but only the back of the device is visible. The factory is brightly lit with natural light from high windows, showing a clean, organized environment with subtle digital sensor nodes attached to the machinery. The atmosphere is one of high-efficiency and advanced technology. No text or logos are visible. Full-body shots of the workers in appropriate PPE.",
