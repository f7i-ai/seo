The scene features a reliability engineer or maintenance technician in full PPE (white hard hat, safety glasses, white sanitary lab coat or uniform, high-vis vest) inspecting a stainless steel electric motor connected to a pump. The environment is clean but industrial, with shiny stainless steel piping and wet floors indicating a recent washdown. The focus is on the technician inspecting a small, cylindrical stainless steel sensor mounted on the motor. The lighting is bright and clinical (cool tones). No text or overlays. Show the technician from the side or 3/4 view, engaged in the work.",
