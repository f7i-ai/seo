  "image_prompt": "A professional, photo-realistic wide shot of a modern industrial manufacturing floor in 2026. In the foreground, a diverse team of two reliability engineers (one male, one female) wearing clean, high-visibility vests, hard hats, and safety glasses are inspecting a large, complex industrial motor-pump assembly. One engineer is pointing at a small, wireless IIoT sensor mounted on the bearing housing, while the other holds a ruggedized industrial tablet (showing only the back of the device). The background shows a clean, well-lit facility with automated conveyor systems and other high-tech machinery. The lighting is bright and professional, emphasizing a high-tech, efficient industrial environment. No text or digital overlays. Full body shots of the engineers.",
