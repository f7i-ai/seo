  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers and operators (men and women) are wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. They are gathered around a large industrial motor and conveyor belt system. One engineer is pointing at a specific component of the machine, while another holds a tablet (back of the device facing the camera) as if consulting data. The lighting is professional and industrial, with cool blue and warm amber tones highlighting the machinery. The background shows the depth of the factory floor with blurred machinery, emphasizing a busy but organized \"brownfield\" environment. No text or overlays in the image.",
