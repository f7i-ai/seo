  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, wide-angle shot inside a clean, modern manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse team of three maintenance professionals—a Hispanic male maintenance manager in a blue polo and slacks, a Black female reliability engineer with a tablet, and a younger white male technician—are gathered around a large electric motor connected to a conveyor system. The engineer is pointing to data on her tablet, which is displaying a vibration analysis graph. The manager is looking intently at the motor, and the technician is listening.

The lighting is bright and professional, conveying a sense of high-tech competence and collaboration. No text or logos are visible.",
