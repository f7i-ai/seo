  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-quality wide shot of a modern industrial manufacturing facility floor. In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance technicians (men and women of different ages/ethnicities) are gathered around a large conveyor motor. They are wearing professional PPE: hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One technician is holding a tablet (back of device visible) pointing it toward the machinery, implying the use of AR or digital diagnostics. Another is holding a thermal imaging camera. The background is clean, well-lit, and high-tech, showing automated machinery. The lighting is natural and bright, conveying a positive, forward-thinking work environment. No text or overlays.",
