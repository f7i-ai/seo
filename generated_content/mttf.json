  "image_prompt": "A high-angle, professional photograph of a modern industrial manufacturing floor. In the foreground, a diverse team of three reliability engineers (two men, one woman) are standing near a large, complex piece of machinery. They are wearing clean, professional PPE: white hard hats, high-visibility vests over navy blue work shirts, and clear safety glasses. One engineer is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet (showing only the back of the device), pointing toward a specific section of the machine. The lighting is bright and clean, emphasizing a high-tech, well-maintained environment. The background shows blurred rows of automated equipment and yellow safety railings, conveying a sense of scale and precision. No text or digital overlays. Realistic textures on the metal and concrete.",
