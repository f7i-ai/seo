  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern, clean industrial manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (one female, two male) are wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. They are standing around a large industrial pump system. One engineer is pointing at a specific component on the pump, while another holds a tablet (showing only the back of the device) as if referencing data. The background shows blurred production lines with soft, cool blue lighting indicating a high-tech environment. The atmosphere is professional, collaborative, and focused on precision.
