  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern, high-tech manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of three professionals (a Reliability Engineer in a white hard hat, a Maintenance Manager in a blue hard hat, and an Operations Director in a safety vest) are standing around a holographic or glass tablet display. The Engineer is pointing to a rising trend line on the graph displayed on the tablet (back of tablet visible, implying data is being shown to the others). They are wearing safety glasses and ear protection. The background features blurred automated machinery, yellow safety railings, and clean industrial lighting, emphasizing a \"World Class Manufacturing\" environment. No text or words should be visible in the image. The lighting is dynamic, highlighting the professionals and the data discussion.",
