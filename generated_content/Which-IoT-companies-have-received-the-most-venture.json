  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern, clean manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of industrial professionals (a maintenance manager in a blazer and hard hat, and a technician in safety gear and high-vis vest) are looking at a tablet held by the manager. The focus is on their expressions of focused collaboration. The back of the tablet is visible, but the screen is not. In the background, blurred but recognizable, are automated conveyor belts and robotic arms with small, glowing IoT sensors attached to motors. The lighting is a mix of cool industrial blue and warm amber safety lighting. 8k resolution, highly detailed textures on the machinery. No text or words in the image.",
