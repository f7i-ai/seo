  "image_prompt": "A wide-angle, photo-realistic shot of a modern industrial mechanical room. Two large, identical industrial centrifugal pumps (representing N+1 redundancy) are positioned side-by-side. A diverse team of two maintenance professionals—one woman and one man—are performing a routine check. They are wearing clean, professional PPE including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility orange vests over work shirts. One professional is pointing toward a sensor mounted on the pump housing while the other holds a ruggedized tablet (shown from the back, no screen visible). The environment is clean, well-lit, and reflects a high-tech \"Brownfield\" facility with a mix of older piping and modern digital sensors. Full-body view of the professionals.
