  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, high-resolution hero image for a blog post on industrial maintenance. In a clean, brightly lit, modern factory, a diverse team of two maintenance professionals, a Hispanic male and a Black female, are collaborating. The male technician holds a ruggedized tablet displaying a complex vibration analysis graph (FFT spectrum) without any text. He is pointing at a specific peak on the screen, discussing it with the female engineer. The female engineer is looking intently at a large, clean industrial gearbox that is the focus of their attention. A small, wireless IIoT sensor is visibly mounted on the gearbox's bearing housing. Both are wearing professional work attire with high-visibility vests, safety glasses, and hard hats. The background is softly blurred, showing other advanced manufacturing equipment. The overall mood is professional, high-tech, and collaborative. Cinematic lighting with a slight blue and orange color grade.",
