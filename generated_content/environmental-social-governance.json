  "image_prompt": "A wide-angle, photo-realistic shot of a modern, high-tech industrial manufacturing facility in 2026. In the foreground, a diverse team of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are collaborating. They are wearing clean, professional PPE: white hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests over navy blue work uniforms. One person is pointing toward a large, well-maintained industrial motor assembly that has small, unobtrusive wireless sensors attached to it. Another person is holding a rugged industrial tablet (showing only the back of the device). The facility is brightly lit, exceptionally clean, and features green plants integrated into the architectural design of the mezzanine. In the background, other technicians are visible working on a conveyor system. The overall atmosphere is one of precision, safety, and advanced technology. No text or displays are visible. Full-body shots of the professionals.",
