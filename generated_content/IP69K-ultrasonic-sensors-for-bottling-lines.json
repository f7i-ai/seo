  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, high-quality image inside a modern beverage bottling facility. The scene focuses on a section of a stainless steel conveyor belt carrying clear glass bottles. In the foreground, a maintenance engineer wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-visibility vest is inspecting a stainless steel ultrasonic sensor mounted near the line. The engineer is holding a rugged tablet (back of device visible) as if checking data. The background shows the depth of the production line with blurred motion of bottles and other machinery. The lighting is bright, industrial, and clean, emphasizing the hygienic stainless steel environment. No text or words in the image.",
