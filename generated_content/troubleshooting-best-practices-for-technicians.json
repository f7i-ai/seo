In the foreground, a diverse team of two technicians (one male, one female) wearing full PPE (hard hats, safety glasses, high-visibility vests) are inspecting a complex automated conveyor system. The female technician is holding a tablet (back of device visible) and pointing at a specific component on the machine, while the male technician holds a multimeter, looking intently at the area she is indicating. The background shows blurred industrial machinery and digital displays indicating \"System Status.\" The lighting is professional and cool-toned, emphasizing technology and precision.
