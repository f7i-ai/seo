  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, professional hero image of a modern industrial manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse team of maintenance professionals—a man and a woman—are working together. They are wearing appropriate PPE, including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One technician is inspecting a complex piece of machinery with a handheld device (shown from the back, no screen visible), while the other is observing the equipment. The background shows a clean, well-lit \"brownfield\" factory environment with a mix of older and newer machinery, pipes, and industrial sensors. The lighting is natural and bright, conveying a sense of precision and high-tech efficiency. Full-body shots of the workers are shown to emphasize the scale of the industrial environment. No text or logos are visible.",
