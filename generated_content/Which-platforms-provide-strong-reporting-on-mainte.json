  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance professionals (a mix of men and women, various ethnicities) are wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One engineer is holding a ruggedized tablet, showing the back of the device (no screen visible), pointing toward a large industrial motor and pump assembly. In the background, blurred slightly, are automated conveyor belts and robotic arms. The lighting is professional and industrial, with a mix of cool blue factory lighting and warm highlights on the machinery. The atmosphere conveys efficiency, technology, and safety. No text or overlays in the image.",
