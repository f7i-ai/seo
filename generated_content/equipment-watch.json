  "image_prompt": "A professional, photo-realistic wide shot of a modern industrial manufacturing floor. In the foreground, a diverse team of two maintenance professionals (one male, one female) are conducting an inspection. They are wearing clean, high-visibility vests, white hard hats, and safety glasses. One person is pointing toward a large, well-maintained industrial motor/pump assembly, while the other holds a ruggedized tablet (showing only the back of the device). The background shows a clean, organized \"brownfield\" factory environment with various pipes, conveyors, and machinery. The lighting is bright and natural. No text or logos are visible. Full-body view of the workers to emphasize the industrial scale.",
