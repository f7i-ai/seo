  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-quality hero image inside a modern manufacturing facility. The scene features a diverse group of reliability engineers and maintenance technicians (men and women of various ethnicities) wearing standard PPE including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. They are gathered around a large industrial motor and pump assembly. One technician is pointing at a specific component of the machine, while another holds a tablet (back of the device visible only) as if referencing data. The background is slightly blurred but shows a busy, clean factory floor with conveyors and piping. The lighting is professional and industrial, highlighting the team's focus and the machinery. No text or overlays in the image.",
