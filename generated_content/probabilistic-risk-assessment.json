  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, professional wide shot of a modern industrial control room in 2026. A diverse team of three reliability engineers (two men, one woman) are standing around a large, sleek glass table. They are wearing clean, high-visibility vests, hard hats, and safety glasses. One engineer is pointing toward a large, glowing wall-mounted holographic-style dashboard that displays complex logic trees and probability curves. The background shows a clean, highly automated manufacturing floor through a large observation window. The lighting is bright and modern, emphasizing a high-tech, safe, and efficient environment. No text or words are visible on any screens. The engineers are shown full-body, and one is holding a ruggedized tablet, showing only the back of the device.",
