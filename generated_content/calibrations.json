A female technician in a white hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-visibility vest is standing next to a large, complex stainless steel pump system. She is holding a rugged industrial tablet (showing only the back of the device). A male colleague, also in full PPE, stands nearby, gesturing toward a digital sensor integrated into the machinery. The lighting is bright and professional, emphasizing a high-tech, \"Industry 4.0\" atmosphere. The shot is a full-body or medium-wide shot, showing the scale of the industrial environment.
