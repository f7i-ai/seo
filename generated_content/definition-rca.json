  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, photo-realistic wide shot of a modern industrial manufacturing floor. In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are standing near a large, complex piece of machinery. They are wearing clean, professional PPE: white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility yellow vests over work shirts. One technician is pointing toward a specific component of the machine while the others look on intently, engaged in a collaborative discussion. One person is holding a rugged industrial tablet, but only the back of the device is visible to the camera. The background shows a well-lit, organized factory environment with other machinery and safety markings on the floor. The lighting is bright and professional, emphasizing a clean and technologically advanced workspace. No text or logos are visible. Full-body shots of the professionals.",
