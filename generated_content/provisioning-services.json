  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, professional wide shot of a modern, clean industrial warehouse and maintenance bay. In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (two men, one woman) are collaborating. They are wearing clean, professional PPE: white hard hats, high-visibility vests over navy blue work shirts, and safety glasses. One person is pointing toward a neatly organized, high-tech racking system where spare parts are stored in labeled bins with glowing QR codes. Another person is holding a rugged industrial tablet (viewed from the back, showing a reinforced casing). The background shows a large, complex piece of industrial machinery (a turbine or large pump) being serviced in a brightly lit, well-ventilated bay. The atmosphere is one of organized, high-tech efficiency. No text or displays are visible. Full body shots of the professionals are shown.",
