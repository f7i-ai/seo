  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern, clean manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of three reliability engineers (one female, two male) wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests are gathered around a large industrial pump system. They are looking at a tablet held by one of the engineers (back of tablet visible only), pointing at a specific component of the pump, engaged in serious discussion. In the background, blurred slightly, are automated conveyor lines and digital dashboard screens glowing with data visualizations. The lighting is cool industrial blue with warm accent lighting on the machinery. No text or words in the image. High resolution, 8k.",
