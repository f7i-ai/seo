  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, photo-realistic hero image of a modern industrial manufacturing environment. In the foreground, a diverse team of two maintenance professionals (one man, one woman) are standing next to a large, complex piece of industrial machinery (a high-speed bottling line or a large industrial compressor). They are wearing clean, professional PPE, including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility yellow vests over work shirts. One professional is pointing toward a specific section of the machine while holding a ruggedized tablet (shown from the back, no screen visible). The background shows a clean, well-lit factory floor with other machinery slightly out of focus. The lighting is bright and natural, emphasizing a high-tech, efficient atmosphere. No text or logos are visible on the equipment or clothing. Full-body or three-quarter shots to show the scale of the environment.",
