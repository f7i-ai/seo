  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern, high-tech food processing facility. In the foreground, a reliability engineer wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, and a white sanitary lab coat is inspecting a stainless steel washdown motor mounted on a conveyor belt. The engineer is holding a tablet (back facing camera) displaying data graphs. The motor is shiny, silver, and sleek (IP69K style). The background shows a clean, blurred production line with stainless steel piping and machinery. The lighting is bright, cool, and clinical, emphasizing hygiene and technology.
