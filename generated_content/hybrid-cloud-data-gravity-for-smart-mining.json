  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern open-pit mine at twilight. In the foreground, a diverse group of mining engineers and reliability technicians (men and women, various ethnicities) are wearing high-visibility vests, hard hats with lamps, and safety glasses. They are gathered around a ruggedized industrial server rack (Edge Gateway) that is mounted near a large conveyor belt system. One technician is holding a rugged tablet (back facing camera) pointing at the server. In the background, massive autonomous haul trucks are visible, and a private 5G tower stands silhouetted against the darkening sky. The lighting should emphasize the contrast between the dusty, gritty industrial environment and the sleek, blue-LED glow of the edge computing hardware. No text overlays.
