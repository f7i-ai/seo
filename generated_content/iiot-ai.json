  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern manufacturing facility. The lighting is a mix of cool industrial blue and warm amber safety lighting. In the foreground, a reliability engineer (wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-visibility vest) is inspecting a large industrial motor. They are holding a ruggedized tablet, but the screen is facing away from the camera. The focus is on the engineer's interaction with the machine. On the motor, a small, glowing wireless sensor is visible, indicating IIoT connectivity. In the background, blurred slightly, are other diverse workers and automated conveyor systems. The image conveys high-tech precision and industrial scale. No text or overlays.",
