They are wearing full PPE including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests with reflective strips. One technician is holding a tablet device (back of device visible only) showing a digital checklist, gesturing towards a large industrial pump system in the background. In the background, another technician is setting up a welding screen and fire extinguisher, preparing for hot work.
