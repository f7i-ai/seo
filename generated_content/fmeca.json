  "image_prompt": "A wide-angle, photo-realistic shot of a modern industrial manufacturing floor. In the foreground, a diverse team of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are standing near a large, well-maintained centrifugal pump and motor assembly. They are wearing clean, professional PPE: white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility yellow vests over work shirts. One technician is pointing toward the motor housing while another holds a rugged industrial tablet (showing only the black back of the device). The background shows a clean, organized \"brownfield\" factory environment with overhead conveyors and piping, softly blurred to keep focus on the team. The lighting is bright and natural, conveying a sense of efficiency and high-tech reliability. No text or digital displays are visible. Full body shots of the professionals.",
