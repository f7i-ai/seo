  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance technicians (male and female, various ethnicities) are wearing modern PPE including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One technician is holding a ruggedized tablet (back of device visible only) and gesturing toward a large industrial conveyor system.

The lighting is industrial but warm, highlighting the cleanliness and organization of the plant. No text or words should be visible in the image. Focus on professionalism, safety, and technology integration.",
