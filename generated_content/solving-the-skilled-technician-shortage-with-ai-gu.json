  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, high-quality professional image for a blog post about AI-guided maintenance. The setting is a clean, modern, well-lit manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a junior female technician of Hispanic descent and a senior male technician of African descent are collaborating over a complex piece of industrial machinery. The junior technician holds a ruggedized tablet that displays a 3D model of the machine's internals with glowing data points. The senior technician is pointing to a physical component on the machine, which corresponds to the highlighted area on the tablet. Both are wearing appropriate PPE: safety glasses, hard hats, and company-branded work shirts. The background is slightly blurred, showing other machinery and conveying a sense of a large, operational space. The lighting is bright and optimistic, with a slight lens flare to give it a modern, tech-forward feel. There is no text on the image.",
