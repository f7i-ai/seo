In the foreground, a reliability engineer wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, and a sanitary white lab coat is inspecting a large stainless steel industrial homogenizer. They are holding a tablet (back of tablet visible) and looking at a wireless sensor attached to the machine's drive motor. The background features gleaming stainless steel piping, tanks, and soft, cool industrial lighting. The atmosphere conveys cleanliness, high technology, and precision. No text or overlays.",
