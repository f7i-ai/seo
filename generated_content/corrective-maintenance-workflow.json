  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern, clean manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance professionals (a man and a woman) wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests are standing near a large industrial conveyor system. They are looking at the back of a ruggedized tablet held by one of them, discussing a digital workflow or schematic visible on the screen (screen content blurred or abstract). The background shows the depth of the factory with blurred machinery and soft industrial lighting. The atmosphere is calm, professional, and focused on problem-solving, not chaotic. No text overlays. 2026 futuristic industrial vibe but realistic.",
