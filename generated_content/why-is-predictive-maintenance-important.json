  "image_prompt": "A hyper-realistic, cinematic wide shot of a modern manufacturing plant floor. In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers and maintenance technicians (men and women) are walking with purpose, wearing standard PPE including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One technician in the center is holding a ruggedized tablet, but only the back of the device is visible (no screen content). The background features blurred industrial machinery, conveyor belts, and piping, with subtle blue digital overlays or \"digital twin\" wireframes hinting at the predictive technology, but keeping the image grounded in reality. Lighting is professional, industrial cool tones with warm highlights. No text or words in the image. High resolution, 8k.",
