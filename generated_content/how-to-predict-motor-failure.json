A technician is mounting a small, sleek IIoT vibration sensor to the motor housing near the drive-end bearing. In the background, a tablet screen shows a complex vibration spectrum graph with green and red threshold lines. The lighting is professional and clean, highlighting the contrast between the rugged industrial machinery and the modern predictive technology. No text. Photo-realistic.",
