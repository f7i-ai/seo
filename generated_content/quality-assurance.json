In the foreground, a diverse group of three engineers (one female, two male) are wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. They are standing near a large, automated conveyor system. One engineer is pointing at a specific component on the machine, while another holds a tablet (showing only the back of the device) as if referencing data. The background is slightly blurred but shows clean, advanced machinery with soft blue and cool white lighting, emphasizing a \"Quality 4.0\" and futuristic industrial atmosphere. No text or screens visible. High resolution, professional depth of field.",
