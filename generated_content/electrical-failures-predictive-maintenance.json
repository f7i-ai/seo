  "image_prompt": "A hyper-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers and maintenance technicians (men and women, various ethnicities) are conducting an inspection near a large industrial electrical switchgear panel. They are wearing full PPE including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One technician is holding a thermal imaging camera (seen from the back, screen not visible) pointing at the panel. Another is holding a tablet (back of device visible). The background shows blurred production machinery and clean, organized factory lines. The lighting is professional and industrial, with a mix of cool LED factory lights and warm accents from safety indicators. No text or words in the image. Atmosphere conveys competence, safety, and high technology.",
