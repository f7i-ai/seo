  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern food processing facility. The lighting is cool and industrial, with steam rising slightly from the machinery. In the foreground, focused sharply, is a sleek, stainless steel industrial gateway mounted directly onto the side of a conveyor belt frame. The device has M12 cables connected to it. The background shows a blurred production line with workers in full hygienic PPE (white coats, hairnets, safety glasses, gloves) inspecting the line. One worker is holding a tablet (back of tablet visible) likely checking data. The environment looks wet and clean, emphasizing the \"washdown\" nature. No text overlays. High contrast, professional industrial photography style.",
