  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, photo-realistic hero image of a modern industrial manufacturing floor. In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (one female, two male) are collaborating. They are wearing clean, professional PPE including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility yellow vests over work shirts. One technician is pointing toward a large, well-maintained industrial motor/pump assembly, while another holds a ruggedized industrial tablet (showing only the back of the device). The lighting is bright and professional, highlighting the clean, organized nature of a high-tech \"Reliability Centered\" plant. There is no text or logos in the image. The focus is on the teamwork and the advanced industrial environment. Full-body or three-quarter shots to show the scale of the machinery.",
