  "image_prompt": "A hyper-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern, clean manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers and maintenance technicians (wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests) are gathered around a large, complex industrial turbine or motor. One engineer is pointing at a specific component on the machine, while another holds a tablet (screen not visible) referencing a digital schematic. The background shows blurred automated production lines and soft, cool industrial lighting. The atmosphere is professional, technical, and focused on precision. No text or words in the image.",
