  "image_prompt": "A professional, photo-realistic hero image of a diverse group of maintenance professionals (men and women) in a modern but clearly \"brownfield\" industrial manufacturing setting. They are wearing appropriate PPE, including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One technician is standing near a large industrial pump/motor assembly, while a maintenance manager is nearby. They are collaborating on a workflow. The focus is on the teamwork and the industrial environment. Any handheld devices (like a tablet) are shown only from the back, with no screen content visible. The lighting is bright and professional, highlighting the clean but well-used machinery of a functional factory. Full-body shots showing the scale of the equipment. No text or words in the image.",
