  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern manufacturing facility. The scene features a diverse group of reliability engineers and maintenance technicians (men and women) wearing standard PPE including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. They are standing near a large industrial conveyor system. One technician is holding a ruggedized tablet, but the back of the tablet is facing the camera (screen not visible). In the background, subtle, glowing digital lines (representing data flow) connect the machinery to the ceiling, symbolizing the \"nervous system\" of the factory, but the effect should be subtle and blended with the realistic lighting. The lighting is professional, industrial cool tones with warm highlights on the people. No text or words in the image. High resolution, 8k.",
