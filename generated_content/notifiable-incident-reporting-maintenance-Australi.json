  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot of a modern Australian manufacturing facility interior. The scene features a diverse group of maintenance technicians and a WHS officer. They are wearing standard Australian PPE: high-visibility yellow and orange vests with reflective strips, hard hats, safety glasses, and steel-capped boots. One technician is inspecting a large industrial motor or conveyor system. Another person, likely a manager, is holding a tablet device (back of device visible only) looking at the machinery. The lighting is industrial but warm, highlighting the cleanliness and organization of the plant. No text or words should be visible in the image. The atmosphere conveys safety, professionalism, and advanced technology.",
