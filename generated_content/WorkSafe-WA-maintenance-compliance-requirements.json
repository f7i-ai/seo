  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-resolution hero image set inside a modern Western Australian mineral processing facility or manufacturing plant. The scene features a diverse group of three professionals: a Maintenance Manager (male, 40s), an OHS Officer (female, 30s), and a Technician (male, 20s). They are wearing full PPE including hard hats, high-visibility vests with reflective strips, and safety glasses. They are standing near a large industrial conveyor motor. The Technician is holding a rugged tablet (back of device visible only) and pointing at a specific component on the motor. The Manager and OHS Officer are looking at the motor, engaged in a serious but positive discussion. The lighting is industrial but bright, highlighting the cleanliness and organization of the plant. No text or logos should be visible. The atmosphere conveys safety, compliance, and technological integration.",
