  "image_prompt": "A professional, photo-realistic wide shot of a modern industrial manufacturing floor. In the foreground, a diverse team of two maintenance professionals (one male, one female) are collaborating. They are wearing full PPE, including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility orange vests over work clothes. One person is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet (viewed from the back, no screen visible), while the other points toward a large, well-maintained industrial motor assembly on a \"brownfield\" production line. The background shows a clean, organized factory environment with conveyors and overhead piping, softly blurred to keep focus on the professionals. The lighting is bright and natural for an industrial setting. Full-body view of the workers. No text or logos visible.\n\n***\n\n**References:**\n*   *ISO 41001:2018 - Facility Management Systems*\n*   *SMRP Best Practices, 6th Edition*\n*   *Internal Data: Factory AI 2025 Deployment Benchmarks*",
