  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern industrial electrical room. In the foreground, a diverse team of two electrical engineers (one male, one female) are inspecting a large grey switchgear panel. They are wearing appropriate PPE: hard hats with face shields lifted, safety glasses, high-visibility vests over arc-rated clothing (FR shirts), and voltage-rated gloves. The female engineer is holding a tablet (back of device visible) referencing a digital schematic, while the male engineer points to a warning label on the equipment. The background shows rows of industrial electrical distribution equipment, clean and well-lit with cool LED lighting, conveying a sense of high-tech safety and maintenance standards. Depth of field focuses on the workers and the panel they are inspecting. No text or words visible in the image.",
