In the foreground, a reliability engineer (wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, ear protection, and a heavy insulated freezer jacket) is inspecting the drive motor of the spiral freezer. They are holding a vibration analysis tool (back of device visible) against the motor housing. The background shows the spiral conveyor belt laden with frozen food products (like pastries or patties) moving upwards.
