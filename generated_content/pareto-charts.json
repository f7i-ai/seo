  "image_prompt": "A professional, photo-realistic wide shot of a modern industrial manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse team of three reliability engineers (two men, one woman) wearing clean, high-visibility vests, white hard hats, and safety glasses are standing near a large, well-maintained centrifugal pump assembly. One engineer is pointing toward a specific component of the pump while the others look on, engaged in a technical discussion. One engineer is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet, but only the back of the device is visible. The background shows a clean, brightly lit factory floor with various pipes, valves, and machinery, all following industrial safety standards. No text or digital overlays are visible. The lighting is natural and bright, emphasizing a high-tech, efficient industrial environment.",
