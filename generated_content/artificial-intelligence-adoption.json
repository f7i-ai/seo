  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern, clean manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers and maintenance technicians (wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests) are gathered around a large industrial pump and motor assembly. One technician is pointing at a specific component on the motor, while another holds a tablet (back of device visible only) that implies they are reading data. In the background, blurred slightly to create depth, are automated conveyor lines and digital dashboard screens glowing with data visualizations (graphs and heatmaps, no legible text). The lighting is professional industrial lighting, with a mix of cool blue tones from the machinery and warm tones highlighting the people. The image conveys collaboration, technology integration, and industrial precision. No text overlays.",
