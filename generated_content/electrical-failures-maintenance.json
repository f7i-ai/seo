  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern, clean industrial electrical room. In the foreground, a diverse maintenance technician (wearing a hard hat, safety glasses, and FR-rated clothing) is using a handheld thermal imaging camera to scan a large, open electrical switchgear cabinet. The back of the camera is visible, showing a heat map on the screen, but no text is legible. In the background, out of focus, another technician is looking at a tablet. The lighting is professional, with cool blue ambient light from the equipment LEDs contrasting with the warm lighting of the room. The image conveys high-tech reliability and safety. No text or words in the image.",
