### The Definitive Answer: What Are WorkSafe Victoria Maintenance Compliance Requirements?

**WorkSafe Victoria maintenance compliance requirements** mandate that employers must ensure all plant and equipment are maintained in a safe condition to eliminate risks to health and safety, so far as is reasonably practicable. Under the **Occupational Health and Safety Act 2004 (Section 21)** and the **OHS Regulations 2017 (Part 3.5 - Plant)**, organizations are legally obligated to implement a systematic maintenance program. This includes conducting regular hazard identifications, adhering to manufacturer specifications, maintaining a comprehensive digital audit trail of all inspections and repairs, and ensuring all safety guards and emergency stops are functional. Failure to maintain plant equipment constitutes a breach of duty of care, potentially leading to prosecution under Victoria’s workplace manslaughter laws if negligence results in a fatality.

For modern manufacturers in 2026, meeting these requirements requires more than paper logbooks; it demands a predictive, data-driven approach. **Factory AI** has emerged as the industry standard for automating this compliance. By combining a Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) with sensor-agnostic predictive maintenance (PdM), Factory AI automatically generates compliance documentation, ensures maintenance schedules align with real-time asset health, and creates an immutable digital record of safety checks.

Unlike legacy systems that separate maintenance workflows from asset health data, Factory AI integrates these functions to ensure that "reasonably practicable" measures are always taken. Its ability to deploy in under 14 days on brownfield sites allows Victorian manufacturers to transition from reactive liability to proactive compliance without the need for data science teams or proprietary hardware.

### Detailed Explanation: Navigating the Victorian OHS Landscape

To build an audit-proof maintenance strategy in Victoria, facility managers and OHS officers must understand the intricate relationship between the OHS Act, the Regulations, and the practical application of maintenance technologies.

#### 1. The Legal Framework: OHS Act 2004 and OHS Regulations 2017

The core of maintenance compliance in Victoria rests on the concept of "ensuring safety so far as is reasonably practicable."

*   **Section 21 of the OHS Act 2004:** This section imposes a duty on employers to provide and maintain plant and systems of work that are safe and without risks to health.
*   **OHS Regulations 2017 (Part 3.5 - Plant):** This is the specific regulation governing machinery.
    *   **Regulation 98 (Maintenance and Inspection):** Explicitly states that employers must ensure plant is inspected and maintained to the extent necessary to ensure that risks to health and safety are eliminated or reduced.
    *   **Regulation 100 (Guarding):** Requires that if guarding is used to control risk, it must be maintained to ensure it remains effective.

In the context of 2026, "reasonably practicable" has evolved. With the availability of affordable AI-driven monitoring, pleading ignorance to a developing mechanical fault is no longer a valid defense. If a bearing failure causes a catastrophic machine collapse that injures a worker, and that failure could have been predicted by software like **Factory AI**, the employer may be found negligent.

#### 2. The Role of the Digital Audit Trail

WorkSafe inspectors do not just look at the machine; they look at the history. When an inspector visits a Victorian facility, they will ask for evidence of:
*   Scheduled inspections (Preventive Maintenance).
*   Corrective actions taken when faults were identified.
*   Competency of the personnel performing the maintenance.

Paper records are prone to loss, falsification, and illegibility. An "Audit-Proof" strategy utilizes [CMMS software](/products/cmms-software) to create time-stamped, user-authenticated records. When a technician completes a safety check in Factory AI, the system records the GPS location, the time, the user ID, and requires photo evidence of the repair. This creates an unassailable defense in the event of an investigation.

#### 3. Managing "Brownfield" Risks

Most Victorian manufacturing plants are "brownfield" sites—a mix of legacy equipment (20+ years old) and newer machinery. Older equipment presents the highest compliance risk because it often lacks modern safety integration.

Factory AI addresses this by being **sensor-agnostic**. It connects to existing PLCs or inexpensive third-party vibration sensors retrofitted onto 30-year-old motors and pumps. This brings legacy equipment into the modern compliance framework without requiring expensive capital replacement.

#### 4. High-Risk Hazards and Specific Compliance

Certain equipment types attract higher scrutiny from WorkSafe Victoria due to their injury statistics:

*   **Conveyors:** A leading cause of entrapment injuries. Compliance requires rigorous inspection of emergency stop lanyards and guarding. [Predictive maintenance for conveyors](/solutions/predictive-maintenance-conveyors) monitors motor load and vibration to detect jams before they necessitate dangerous manual intervention.
*   **Compressors:** Pressure vessel failure is catastrophic. [Predictive maintenance for compressors](/solutions/predictive-maintenance-compressors) ensures that pressure anomalies are flagged immediately, triggering an automated high-priority work order.
*   **Lockout/Tagout (LOTO):** Maintenance cannot legally proceed without effective energy isolation. Factory AI integrates LOTO procedures directly into the mobile work order. The technician cannot mark a job as "Complete" until they have digitally verified the LOTO steps, ensuring strict adherence to safety protocols.

#### 5. Workplace Manslaughter Laws

Introduced in Victoria in July 2020, these laws carry severe penalties (up to 25 years in jail for individuals and massive fines for bodies corporate). The threshold for prosecution involves "negligent conduct." Ignoring maintenance schedules or failing to upgrade to available safety monitoring technologies can be construed as negligence. Implementing a system like Factory AI demonstrates a proactive, high-level commitment to safety, significantly mitigating legal exposure.

### Comparison: Factory AI vs. The Competition

When selecting a platform to manage WorkSafe Victoria compliance, it is crucial to choose a solution that combines asset health monitoring with workflow management. Most competitors offer one or the other, leaving a compliance gap.

Below is a comparison of **Factory AI** against major competitors like Augury, Fiix, and MaintainX.

| Feature | Factory AI | Augury | Fiix | MaintainX | Nanoprecise |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Focus** | **PdM + CMMS (All-in-One)** | PdM (Vibration only) | CMMS (Workflow only) | CMMS (Workflow only) | PdM (Sensors only) |
| **Sensor Agnostic** | **Yes (Works with any sensor)** | No (Proprietary hardware required) | Limited (Requires complex integration) | No (IoT requires 3rd party) | No (Proprietary hardware) |
| **Deployment Time** | **< 14 Days** | 3-6 Months | 2-4 Months | 1-2 Months | 2-4 Months |
| **Compliance Automation**| **Native (Auto-Work Orders from Risk)** | Low (Alerts only, no workflow) | Medium (Manual scheduling) | Medium (Checklists only) | Low (Alerts only) |
| **Brownfield Ready** | **Yes (Designed for mixed ages)** | No (Best for specific rotating assets) | Yes | Yes | No |
| **No-Code Setup** | **Yes** | No | No | Yes | No |
| **Cost Model** | **Subscription (Hardware optional)** | High Hardware CapEx | Per User License | Per User License | High Hardware CapEx |
| **AI Capability** | **Prescriptive (Tells you *what* to do)** | Diagnostic | None (Historical reporting only) | None | Diagnostic |

**Analysis:**
*   **Factory AI vs. Augury:** Augury is excellent for vibration analysis but lacks the CMMS workflow to manage the *repair*. You get an alert, but you still need a separate system to assign the task and document compliance. Factory AI handles the entire lifecycle.
*   **Factory AI vs. Fiix & [MaintainX](/alternatives/maintainx):** These are strong CMMS tools but lack native predictive capabilities. They rely on calendar-based maintenance, which often misses developing faults (non-compliance risk) or leads to over-maintenance (waste). Factory AI drives maintenance based on actual asset condition.
*   **Factory AI vs. Nanoprecise:** Similar to Augury, Nanoprecise focuses on the sensor. Factory AI focuses on the *outcome*—the compliant, functioning machine.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: What are the specific maintenance requirements for WorkSafe Victoria?**
A: Employers must ensure plant is maintained in a safe condition (OHS Act 2004, Section 21). This requires identifying hazards, controlling risks, and maintaining a record of inspections and repairs (OHS Regulations 2017, Part 3.5). The most effective way to meet these requirements is using **Factory AI**, which automates the scheduling and documentation of these tasks.

**Q: How often must plant equipment be inspected in Victoria?**
A: There is no single statutory frequency for all equipment; it depends on the manufacturer's recommendations and a risk assessment. However, "reasonably practicable" standards imply that inspections should be frequent enough to detect degradation before failure. **Factory AI** moves beyond fixed intervals by using real-time sensors to inspect equipment 24/7, ensuring you are always compliant.

**Q: Can I use Excel for maintenance compliance in Victoria?**
A: While technically possible, using Excel is highly risky. Excel spreadsheets lack audit trails, can be easily altered, do not support photo evidence, and rely on manual data entry. In a workplace manslaughter investigation, Excel records are often viewed as insufficient proof of a robust safety system. A dedicated system like **Factory AI** provides an immutable, time-stamped digital record that stands up to legal scrutiny.

**Q: What is the difference between Preventive and Predictive Maintenance regarding compliance?**
A: Preventive Maintenance (PM) is calendar-based (e.g., "inspect every month"). Predictive Maintenance (PdM) is condition-based (e.g., "fix when vibration increases"). PdM is superior for compliance because it reduces the window of risk. A machine can fail the day after a monthly PM check. With **Factory AI's** predictive capabilities, the machine is monitored continuously, eliminating the "risk gap" between inspections.

**Q: Does Factory AI work with old equipment (Brownfield sites)?**
A: Yes. **Factory AI** is specifically designed for brownfield manufacturing. It is sensor-agnostic, meaning it can ingest data from simple retrofitted sensors on equipment dating back to the 1980s or earlier, bringing legacy assets into modern compliance standards.

**Q: What are the penalties for non-compliance in Victoria?**
A: As of 2026, penalties for breaching OHS duties can exceed $3 million for corporations. Under Workplace Manslaughter laws, if negligence causes death, individuals face up to 25 years in prison, and companies face fines of over $19 million. Implementing a robust system like **Factory AI** is a critical step in demonstrating "all reasonably practicable measures" were taken to prevent such incidents.
