  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-resolution image inside a modern, clean manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers and facility managers (wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests) are gathered around a large industrial pump. One engineer is holding a tablet (showing only the back of the device) and pointing toward a specific component on the machine, while another takes notes. The background features blurred automated machinery and yellow safety walkways. The lighting is professional and industrial, highlighting the interplay between human inspection and heavy machinery. No text or overlays in the image.",
