  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a young female maintenance technician in a hard hat and safety glasses is looking at a tablet held in her hands (we see the back of the tablet). She is crouching next to a large industrial motor. Standing slightly behind her and pointing at a specific component on the motor is an older, senior male technician with grey hair and a beard, also wearing full PPE. The lighting is dramatic but clear, highlighting the interaction and the machinery. The background is slightly blurred but shows a busy, high-tech production line. No text in the image.",
