  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot of a modern, high-tech factory floor in the year 2026. The lighting is cool and industrial, with clean lines and metallic surfaces. In the foreground, a diverse group of two engineers (one male, one female) are looking at a tablet; the back of the tablet is visible, not the screen. They are wearing modern PPE including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. In the background, automated robotic arms are working on an assembly line. There are subtle visual cues of digital connectivity, perhaps soft LED status lights on the machinery (green and blue), but no floating holograms or sci-fi text. The atmosphere conveys efficiency, cleanliness, and advanced technology.",
