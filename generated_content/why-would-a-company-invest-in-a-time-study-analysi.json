  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern, clean manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of industrial engineers and maintenance technicians (wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-vis vests) are collaborating. One engineer is holding a tablet (back facing camera) pointing toward a complex conveyor system, while a technician points at a specific component. In the background, automated machinery and robotic arms are in motion. The lighting is bright and industrial, with a cool blue and steel color palette. The image conveys collaboration, precision, and modern technology. No text or overlays.",
