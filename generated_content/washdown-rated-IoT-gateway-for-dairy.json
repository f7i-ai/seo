  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-resolution image inside a modern dairy processing facility. The scene shows a stainless steel industrial environment with large tanks and piping. In the foreground, slightly to the side, is a robust, stainless steel IoT gateway enclosure mounted on a wall using sanitary standoffs. The enclosure has a sloped top and M12 cable connectors. A maintenance technician, wearing a white food-safety coat, hairnet, safety glasses, and blue nitrile gloves, is inspecting the device, holding a rugged tablet (screen not visible). In the background, another worker in full PPE is performing a washdown of a tank using a hose, with visible steam or mist, illustrating the harsh, wet environment. The lighting is bright, cool, and clinical, typical of food production areas. No text or logos on the equipment.",
