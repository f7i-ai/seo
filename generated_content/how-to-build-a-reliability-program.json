  "image_prompt": "A professional, photo-realistic wide shot of a modern industrial manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse team of three professionals—a male maintenance manager in a white hard hat and high-visibility vest, a female reliability engineer in a blue hard hat and safety glasses, and a technician in a grey work uniform—are standing near a large, complex piece of machinery (a multi-stage conveyor system with motors and gearboxes). The maintenance manager is gesturing toward a specific section of the machine while the engineer holds a rugged industrial tablet (shown from the back, display not visible). The environment is clean, well-lit, and organized, reflecting a high-standard reliability culture. All individuals are wearing appropriate PPE, including steel-toed boots and ear protection. The background shows the blurred activity of a productive factory floor. No text or logos are visible.",
