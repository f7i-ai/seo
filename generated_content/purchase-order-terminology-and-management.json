  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance professionals and a plant manager are gathered around a large industrial machine (perhaps a conveyor or pump system). They are wearing standard PPE including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One technician is holding a tablet (back of device visible only) pointing toward a sensor on the machine. The background shows a busy, clean production floor with blurred motion of machinery. The lighting is professional and industrial, with a mix of cool factory lighting and warm highlights. No text or overlays in the image. The atmosphere conveys collaboration, technology integration, and efficiency.",
