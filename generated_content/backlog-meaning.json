  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-resolution image of a modern manufacturing plant floor. In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance technicians (men and women) are wearing standard PPE including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. They are gathered around a large industrial motor or conveyor belt. One technician is holding a tablet, showing the back of the device to the camera (screen hidden), pointing toward the machinery as if discussing a specific maintenance task. The background shows a clean, busy factory environment with blurred motion of machinery to imply activity. The lighting is professional and industrial, with a mix of cool factory lighting and warm highlights. No text or overlays in the image.",
