The scene features a diverse group of maintenance technicians and a safety manager. One technician is wearing a full-body safety harness and a hard hat, preparing to ascend a scissor lift to work on overhead ducting. The safety manager, wearing a high-visibility vest and safety glasses, is holding a tablet (back of device visible only) and appears to be discussing a digital checklist with the technician. The background shows blurred industrial machinery and yellow safety walkways. The lighting is bright and professional, emphasizing safety and technology. No text or overlays in the image.",
