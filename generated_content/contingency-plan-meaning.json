  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers and maintenance technicians (wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests) are gathered around a large industrial pump. One technician is holding a tablet (back facing the camera) while pointing at the machinery, discussing a strategy. In the background, automated conveyor belts and robotic arms are in motion, slightly blurred to emphasize the depth of the facility. The lighting is a mix of cool industrial LED and warm ambient light, highlighting the clean, high-tech nature of the environment. No text or overlays in the image. The atmosphere conveys professionalism, collaboration, and advanced technology.",
