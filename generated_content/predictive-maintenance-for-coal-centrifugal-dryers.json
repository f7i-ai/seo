  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern industrial coal preparation plant. The focus is on a large, yellow industrial centrifugal dryer (vertical basket type) amidst complex steel piping and walkways. A reliability engineer in a white hard hat, safety glasses, and high-visibility vest is standing near the machine, looking at the back of a ruggedized tablet held in their hand (screen not visible). In the background, slightly out of focus, another technician is inspecting a conveyor belt. The lighting is industrial but dramatic, highlighting the texture of the machinery and the \"connected\" nature of the modern plant. No text or overlays. 8k resolution.",
