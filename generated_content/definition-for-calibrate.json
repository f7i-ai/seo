  "image_prompt": "A professional, photo-realistic hero image of a diverse maintenance team in a modern industrial manufacturing facility. A female technician and a male engineer are collaborating near a complex conveyor system. Both are wearing full PPE, including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility yellow vests. The technician is holding a professional handheld calibration device, showing only the back of the ruggedized grey casing (no screen visible). The engineer is pointing toward a sensor mounted on a large industrial motor. The background shows a clean, well-lit \"brownfield\" factory environment with stainless steel piping and various mechanical components. The shot is a full-body medium-long shot, capturing the scale of the machinery and the professional focus of the team. No text or logos are visible.",
