In the foreground, a diverse team of two maintenance professionals (one male, one female) wearing clean, high-visibility vests, hard hats, and safety glasses are performing a forensic inspection on a large industrial electric motor. One technician is using a handheld thermal imaging camera (shown from the back, display not visible), while the other is taking notes on a ruggedized tablet. The motor is clean but shows signs of industrial use, with conduit and cooling fins clearly visible. The background shows a clean, well-lit production line with robotic arms and conveyors. The lighting is bright and industrial, emphasizing a high-tech, reliable environment. No text or words appear in the image. Full body shots of the professionals.",
