  "image_prompt": "A professional, photo-realistic scene in a modern industrial manufacturing facility at night. A diverse pair of maintenance technicians—one man and one woman—are working together to inspect a large, complex piece of machinery. They are wearing full PPE, including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One technician is pointing at a specific mechanical component while the other holds a ruggedized industrial tablet (showing only the back of the device). The background shows the blurred lights of a clean, high-tech factory floor. The lighting is focused on the technicians and the machine, creating a sense of focused, expert activity. No text or displays are visible. Full-body shot showing their professional stance and safety gear.",
