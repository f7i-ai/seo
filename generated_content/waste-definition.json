  "image_prompt": "A wide-angle, photo-realistic shot of a modern, clean industrial manufacturing floor. In the foreground, a diverse team of three maintenance professionals—a man in his 40s, a woman in her 30s, and a younger man—are standing near a large, complex industrial motor. They are all wearing full PPE, including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility orange vests over work shirts. One technician is pointing toward a specific part of the machinery while another holds a ruggedized industrial tablet; the tablet is held so only its black protective back is visible to the camera. The lighting is bright and professional, highlighting the polished concrete floor and the well-maintained equipment. There are no words, logos, or text visible on any surfaces. The focus is on the collaborative, high-tech nature of modern industrial maintenance.",
