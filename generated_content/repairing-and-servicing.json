  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, photo-realistic hero image of a modern industrial manufacturing floor. In the foreground, a diverse team of two maintenance professionals (one male, one female) are collaborating. They are wearing appropriate PPE, including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility neon vests over work shirts. One professional is pointing toward a large, well-maintained industrial motor assembly on a clean production line, while the other holds a ruggedized industrial tablet (showing only the back of the device). The background shows a clean, organized \"brownfield\" factory environment with various pipes, conveyors, and machinery, softly blurred to keep focus on the professionals. The lighting is bright and professional, conveying a sense of high-tech efficiency and safety. No text or logos are visible. Full-body or three-quarter shots to show the industrial context.",
