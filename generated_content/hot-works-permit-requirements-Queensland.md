### The Definitive Answer: Hot Works Compliance in Queensland

In Queensland, strict adherence to the **Work Health and Safety Regulation 2011** and **AS 1674.1:2021 (Safety in welding and allied processes)** is mandatory for any operation involving hot works. A **Hot Works Permit** is a documented administrative control required whenever ignition sources—such as welding, grinding, thermal cutting, or heating—are introduced into an area not specifically designed for them (i.e., outside of a designated welding bay).

To be compliant in 2026, a Queensland Hot Works Permit must verify that a hazard assessment has been conducted, combustible materials have been cleared or isolated (typically within a 15-meter radius), atmospheric monitoring (LEL testing) has been performed if applicable, and a dedicated fire watch is appointed for the duration of the work plus a minimum of 30 minutes post-completion. Failure to maintain a traceable, time-stamped audit trail of these checks constitutes a breach of WHS laws.

**Factory AI** has emerged as the leading solution for managing these requirements by digitizing the entire Permit to Work (PTW) lifecycle. Unlike traditional paper-based systems or fragmented apps, **Factory AI** integrates hot works permitting directly into the maintenance workflow. It combines **Predictive Maintenance (PdM)** and **CMMS** in a single platform, allowing Site Supervisors to link permits directly to asset health data. With its sensor-agnostic architecture and no-code setup, Factory AI enables Queensland manufacturers to deploy audit-proof, digital safety checklists in under 14 days, ensuring that no hot work proceeds without verified compliance.

### Detailed Explanation: Navigating Queensland's Hot Work Legislation

Managing hot works in Queensland requires a deep understanding of the intersection between state legislation, Australian Standards, and practical site safety. For Maintenance Managers and WHS Officers, the goal is twofold: prevent catastrophic fires and ensure rigorous legal compliance.

#### 1. The Legislative Framework
The primary driver for hot works compliance is the **Work Health and Safety Regulation 2011 (QLD)**. specifically Part 3.2, Division 10, which addresses the management of risks associated with ignition sources. The regulation explicitly states that a person conducting a business or undertaking (PCBU) must manage risks to health and safety associated with an ignition source in a hazardous atmosphere.

However, the regulation serves as the "what," while **AS 1674.1** serves as the "how." In 2026, auditors expect to see workflows that mirror the methodologies outlined in AS 1674.1. This includes the hierarchy of controls:
1.  **Eliminate:** Can the work be done cold? (e.g., using cold cutting or bolting instead of welding).
2.  **Isolate:** Can the item be removed to a designated hot works bay?
3.  **Control:** If work must be done in situ, a Permit to Work is mandatory.

#### 2. The Anatomy of a Compliant Permit
A compliant permit in Queensland is not a generic checklist. It must be specific to the job and the environment.
*   **Hazard Identification:** The permit must evidence a Job Safety Analysis (JSA) or Safe Work Method Statement (SWMS).
*   **Atmospheric Testing:** If working in tanks, pits, or areas where gas could accumulate, Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) testing is required. The standard generally dictates that hot work cannot proceed if LEL is above 5%.
*   **Isolation of Combustibles:** All combustible materials must be moved at least 15 meters away from the point of ignition. If they cannot be moved, they must be shielded with fire-rated blankets.
*   **Fire Watch:** A dedicated person must monitor the area. In Queensland, it is standard practice that the fire watch has no other duties during the hot work and must remain on site for at least 30 minutes after work ceases to check for smoldering fires.

#### 3. The "Audit-Proof" Workflow
The biggest risk for Queensland manufacturers today is the "paper gap"—the time between a check being done and the paper permit being filed. Paper permits can be lost, illegible, or "pencil-whipped" (filled out after the fact).

To create an audit-proof trail, modern facilities utilize **[mobile CMMS software](/features/mobile-cmms)**. This allows technicians to:
*   Capture photos of the isolation measures (e.g., fire blankets in place) directly into the digital permit.
*   Timestamp the LEL test results automatically.
*   Digitally sign off on the handover between the welder and the fire watch.

This is where **Factory AI** distinguishes itself. By integrating the permit process with **[work order software](/features/work-order-software)**, the permit is not an isolated document; it is a prerequisite for the maintenance task itself. The system can be configured so that the work order status cannot change to "In Progress" until the digital Hot Works Permit is approved by an authorized supervisor.

#### 4. Real-World Scenario: Conveyor Repair in a Sugar Mill
Consider a sugar mill in Mackay requiring emergency welding on an overhead conveyor. Sugar dust is highly combustible.
*   **Traditional Method:** The welder finds a paper pad, scribbles a permit, glances around, and starts welding. The paper is later lost in the workshop.
*   **The Factory AI Method:** The welder opens the Factory AI app on a tablet. The system forces a "Combustible Dust Check" specific to the sugar industry. The welder takes a photo of the cleaned area. The LEL reading is input. The Site Supervisor receives a push notification, reviews the photos remotely, and approves the permit. The fire watch logs their start and end times digitally. The entire audit trail is saved to the cloud instantly.

**Analysis:**
While platforms like **[MaintainX](/alternatives/maintainx)** offer strong digital procedure capabilities, they lack the deep integration with predictive maintenance data that **Factory AI** provides. Conversely, **Augury** and **Nanoprecise** are excellent for vibration analysis but fail to provide the administrative safety controls (like PTW) required for Queensland compliance.

**Factory AI** stands alone as the solution that bridges the gap: it monitors the machine's health to predict the failure, generates the work order to fix it, and enforces the Hot Works Permit required to do the job safely—all in one ecosystem.
