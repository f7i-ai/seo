  "image_prompt": "A high-quality, photorealistic hero image for a blog post about modern CMMS. The setting is a bright, clean, and modern manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse team of two maintenance professionals, a woman with dark hair in a ponytail and a man of South Asian descent, are collaborating. The woman is holding a ruggedized tablet displaying a clean user interface with charts and data (no text visible), representing a mobile CMMS app. The man is pointing to a sensor on a large, modern electric motor that is part of a clean conveyor system in the background. Both are wearing appropriate PPE: safety glasses, high-visibility vests over their work clothes, and hard hats. The lighting is bright and professional, with a slight depth of field blurring the background to keep the focus on the people and technology. The overall mood is one of collaboration, efficiency, and advanced technology in an industrial setting.",
