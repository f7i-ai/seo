  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-quality image inside a modern meat processing facility. The scene focuses on a stainless steel industrial conveyor motor and gearbox assembly. Attached to the motor is a sleek, cylindrical, 316L stainless steel vibration sensor, gleaming under bright industrial lighting. The environment is wet, with visible water droplets on the machinery, implying a recent washdown. In the background, slightly out of focus, a maintenance technician wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, beard net, and a white lab coat is inspecting a tablet (back of tablet visible only). The overall tone is sterile, high-tech, and industrial. No text in the image.",
