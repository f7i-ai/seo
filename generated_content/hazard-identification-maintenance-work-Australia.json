  "image_prompt": "A hyper-realistic, wide-angle shot of a modern Australian manufacturing facility interior. In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance technicians (men and women) are conducting a safety briefing. They are wearing standard Australian PPE: high-visibility orange and yellow vests with reflective strips, hard hats, safety glasses, and steel-capped boots. One technician is holding a ruggedized tablet, showing the back of the device to the camera (screen not visible). In the background, blurred but distinguishable, are heavy industrial assets like conveyors and large pumps, painted in industrial safety colors. The lighting is bright and professional, emphasizing a clean, high-tech, and safe working environment. No text or words should be visible in the image.",
