  "image_prompt": "A professional maintenance manager and a senior technician standing in a modern, brightly lit 2026 manufacturing facility. They are conducting an audit of a complex industrial pump system. The manager, a woman in her 40s, is wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-visibility vest over a professional work shirt. She is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet, but we only see the back of the device. The technician, a man in his 50s, is wearing a blue hard hat and similar safety gear, pointing toward a specific component on the pump. The environment is clean, with clear safety markings on the floor and other high-tech machinery in the blurred background. The lighting is natural and crisp, emphasizing a high-tech, professional atmosphere. Full-body shot showing their stance and the scale of the equipment. No text or digital displays are visible.",
