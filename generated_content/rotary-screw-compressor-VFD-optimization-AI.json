  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern industrial compressor room. In the foreground, a reliability engineer (wearing a hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-vis vest) is inspecting a large, industrial rotary screw compressor. The engineer is holding a tablet (back of tablet visible) that is connected via a cable to a sleek edge gateway device mounted on the side of the compressor. The background shows piping, receiver tanks, and other industrial machinery, slightly out of focus to emphasize the subject. The lighting is cool industrial blue with warm accent lighting on the compressor control panel, symbolizing the integration of technology and heavy machinery. No text or words in the image. 8k resolution.",
