  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-quality image inside a modern, clean industrial manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse maintenance technician (wearing a hard hat, safety glasses, and high-visibility vest) is standing next to a large, complex industrial machine (perhaps a conveyor or motor assembly). The technician is looking at a ruggedized tablet held in their hand (showing the back of the device, no screen content visible), appearing to reference data or a schematic while inspecting the machine. In the background, slightly out of focus, another worker in PPE is observing a different section of the line. The lighting is bright and professional, highlighting the clean, high-tech nature of modern manufacturing (Industry 4.0). No text or words in the image.",
