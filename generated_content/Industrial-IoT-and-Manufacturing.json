In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers and technicians (wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests) are gathered around a large industrial motor. One technician is using a tablet (back of device visible) to scan a QR code on the machine, while another points to a wireless sensor attached to the motor housing. The background shows a clean, high-tech production line with blurred motion of automated machinery. The lighting is professional and industrial, with cool blue tones accented by warm safety lighting.
