In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance professionals (a man and a woman) are wearing high-visibility vests, safety glasses, and hard hats. They are standing next to a large, complex industrial machine (like a conveyor system or automated assembly unit). The woman is holding a ruggedized tablet, showing the back of the device, pointing at a specific component on the machine, while the man looks on, holding a digital testing tool. The background is slightly blurred but shows the depth of the factory with other workers and automated machinery. The lighting is professional, cool industrial blue and white tones, emphasizing technology and precision. No text or screens visible.",
