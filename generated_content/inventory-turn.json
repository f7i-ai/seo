In the foreground, a diverse team of maintenance professionals (one man, one woman) are wearing clean, high-visibility vests, hard hats, and safety glasses. They are standing near organized industrial shelving units filled with neatly labeled spare parts like motors and gearboxes. One professional is holding a ruggedized tablet (viewed from the back, showing a protective case) while pointing toward a piece of machinery in the background. The lighting is bright and clean, typical of a well-maintained 2026 manufacturing facility. No text or screens are visible. Full-body view of the workers.",
