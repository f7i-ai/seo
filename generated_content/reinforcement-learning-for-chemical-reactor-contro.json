  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern chemical plant control room. In the foreground, a diverse group of process engineers (wearing hard hats and safety glasses) are looking at a large bank of monitors. The monitors display complex data visualizations, heat maps of a reactor, and neural network topology diagrams, but no legible text. One engineer in the center is holding a tablet, back facing the camera. In the background, through a large safety glass window, the blurred industrial silhouette of a large stainless steel chemical reactor and piping is visible. The lighting is professional, with cool blue tones from the screens contrasting with the warm industrial lighting of the plant floor. High-tech, 2026 aesthetic.",
