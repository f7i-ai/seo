  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern, well-lit Western Australian warehouse or distribution center. In the foreground, a diverse group of industrial workers (men and women) are conducting a safety briefing; they are wearing high-visibility vests (orange/yellow) with reflective strips, hard hats, and safety glasses. One worker is holding a tablet (back of device visible only) gesturing toward a yellow counterbalance forklift in the mid-ground. The forklift is clean and modern. In the background, high racking systems are stocked with pallets. The lighting is cool industrial LED with a subtle warm sunlight filtering through a skylight. No text or words should be visible in the image. The atmosphere conveys safety, professionalism, and technology integration.",
