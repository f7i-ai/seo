The dashboard displays a 3D digital twin of a production line overlaid with real-time data: green \"Production\" flow lines and blue \"Maintenance\" work order icons. In the background, through a large window, a clean, modern manufacturing floor with robotic arms is visible. The lighting is bright and professional, emphasizing a \"single source of truth\" digital environment. No text on the screens, only charts and 3D models.",
