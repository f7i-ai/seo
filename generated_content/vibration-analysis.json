  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, high-quality image set in a clean, modern manufacturing facility. A female maintenance manager of color with her hair in a net and wearing safety glasses and a high-visibility vest is standing next to a large industrial electric motor. She is holding a ruggedized tablet that displays a colorful vibration analysis FFT spectrum graph. A male colleague of a different ethnicity, wearing a hard hat and safety glasses, points to a wireless vibration sensor mounted on the motor's bearing housing, and they are discussing the data on the tablet. The background is slightly blurred, showing other machinery and good lighting, emphasizing the two professionals and the technology. The image should be bright, professional, and convey a sense of expertise and collaboration. There should be no text on the image.",
