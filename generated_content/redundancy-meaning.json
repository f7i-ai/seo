  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern, high-tech industrial manufacturing facility. The lighting is cool blue and industrial grey, with highlights of safety yellow. In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers (men and women, wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests) are inspecting a large, complex pumping system. The system clearly shows \"N+1\" redundancy, with three identical large industrial pumps lined up in a row, connected by shiny steel piping. One engineer is using a handheld thermal imaging tool (seen from the back) to inspect the middle pump. The background blurs into the depth of the factory floor. The image conveys precision, technology, and reliability. No text or words in the image.",
