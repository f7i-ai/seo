  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot of a modern manufacturing plant floor in 2026. The lighting is a mix of cool industrial blue and warm amber safety lighting. In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance engineers (men and women) wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests are looking at a large industrial machine (like a compressor or conveyor). One engineer is holding a tablet, but only the back of the tablet is visible. The machine has small, modern wireless sensors attached to it with glowing LED indicators. The background shows a depth of field with other machinery and blurred movement of automated guided vehicles. No text or words in the image. High resolution, professional industrial photography style.",
