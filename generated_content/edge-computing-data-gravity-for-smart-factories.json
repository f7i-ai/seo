  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern, high-tech manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a reliability engineer (wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-visibility vest) is inspecting a large industrial motor. The engineer is looking at a ruggedized tablet held in their hand (we see the back of the tablet, not the screen). Attached to the motor is a distinct, glowing industrial sensor device (orange or blue accent light) representing an \"Edge\" device. In the background, blurred slightly to create depth, are automated conveyor belts and robotic arms in motion. The lighting is cool industrial blue with warm accents on the machinery.
