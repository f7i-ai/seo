In the foreground, a diverse group of three industrial professionals (a maintenance manager in a white hard hat, a senior technician in a blue hard hat, and an operations director in safety gear) are standing around a large industrial pump system. They are looking at a ruggedized tablet held by the manager (back of tablet visible only), discussing a digital insight. The background shows blurred automated assembly lines and yellow robotic arms. The lighting is professional industrial lighting with a slight blue hue to emphasize technology. All subjects are wearing safety glasses and high-visibility vests. No text or floating holograms. Focus on the collaboration between human and machine.",
