  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, professional photograph of a diverse group of three maintenance professionals—two men and one woman—standing in a modern, clean industrial manufacturing facility. They are wearing full PPE, including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility yellow vests over work uniforms. One person is pointing toward a large, well-maintained industrial motor and pump assembly in the background, while another holds a ruggedized tablet (showing only the back of the device). The lighting is bright and natural, highlighting the metallic textures of the machinery. The scene conveys a sense of collaborative problem-solving and advanced technology integration in a brownfield environment. Full-body shot, photorealistic, no text or overlays. External authoritative references for industrial standards can be found at [ISO](https://www.iso.org) and [SMRP](https://www.smrp.org).",
