  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-resolution image inside a modern, clean manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of two engineers (one male, one female) wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests are inspecting a large, automated CNC machine. The female engineer is pointing at a specific component of the machine, while the male engineer holds a tablet (back of tablet visible only) as if checking data. In the background, blurred slightly, are automated conveyor belts and robotic arms in motion. The lighting is cool industrial blue with warm highlights on the machinery, emphasizing a high-tech, year 2026 atmosphere. No text or words in the image.",
