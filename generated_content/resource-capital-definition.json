In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are standing near a large, complex piece of machinery. They are wearing clean, professional PPE, including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility vests over work shirts. One technician is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet, showing only the back of the device to the camera. They are engaged in a professional discussion, looking at the machine with a sense of focused expertise.

Full-body shots of the professionals.",
