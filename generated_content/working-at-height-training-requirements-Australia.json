  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-quality hero image inside a modern Australian manufacturing facility. The scene shows a diverse group of maintenance technicians (men and women) conducting a safety briefing. They are wearing full PPE including hard hats, high-visibility vests, and safety glasses. One technician is holding a tablet (back of device visible only) gesturing towards a large overhead conveyor system. In the background, there is a yellow safety cage and clear signage. The lighting is bright and industrial. No text or words should be visible in the image. The atmosphere conveys professionalism, safety, and modern technology.",
