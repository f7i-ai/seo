In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (one female, two male) are wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests.

They are looking confidently at a piece of machinery, discussing a workflow. The background features blurred industrial automation equipment, soft blue and amber lighting indicating active machinery, and a sense of high-tech efficiency.
