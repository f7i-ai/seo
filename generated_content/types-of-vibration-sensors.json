  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, high-quality image of a maintenance engineer, a woman of South Asian descent wearing a hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-visibility vest, using a handheld vibration data collector with a cable leading to a magnetic-mount accelerometer placed on the bearing housing of a large, clean, modern industrial electric motor. In the background, slightly out of focus, a male colleague of African descent is looking at a tablet displaying graphs and machinery schematics. The setting is a bright, clean, and modern manufacturing plant floor. The image should be professional, with no text, and convey a sense of high-tech precision and expertise in industrial maintenance.",
