  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, high-quality image for a blog post about CMMS software. In a bright, clean, modern manufacturing facility, a female maintenance manager of South Asian descent with a tablet is collaborating with a male technician of Black descent. They are standing in front of a large piece of industrial equipment with visible pipes and gauges. Both are wearing safety glasses and high-visibility vests over their work clothes. The manager is pointing to something on the tablet screen, which displays a clean, modern interface with graphs and data, and the technician is looking at the equipment, nodding in understanding. The background is slightly blurred to focus on the two individuals and the technology. The lighting is bright and professional. There is no text or words in the image.",
