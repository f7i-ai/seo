In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance technicians (men and women) are conducting a safety briefing near a large stainless steel storage tank. They are wearing full PPE: hard hats, safety glasses, high-visibility vests, and safety gloves. One technician is holding a ruggedized tablet (showing the back of the device, no screen visible) and gesturing toward the tank entry point, which has a \"Confined Space\" warning sign attached. A tripod-mounted gas detector is visible near the tank hatch. The lighting is industrial but warm, highlighting the professionalism and safety focus of the team. No text overlays. 8k resolution.",
