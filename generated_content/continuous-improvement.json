  "image_prompt": "A high-quality, photorealistic professional image for a blog post about \"continuous improvement\" in an industrial maintenance setting. A diverse team of three maintenance professionals—a white male manager in his 40s, a Black female technician in her 30s, and a younger Hispanic male technician—are gathered around a large, ruggedized tablet in a clean, modern factory. They are all wearing appropriate PPE, including safety glasses and company-branded work shirts. The manager is pointing to a graph on the tablet screen showing an upward trend for OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness). The female technician is holding a wrench and nodding in agreement, while the younger technician looks on intently. In the background, well-maintained industrial machinery with clean floors is visible but slightly out of focus. The lighting is bright and optimistic, conveying a sense of collaboration, data-driven decision-making, and success. The image should be text-free.",
