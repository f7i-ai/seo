The scene should show a slight mist in the air and water droplets on the equipment. A maintenance technician in a white sanitary smock and blue nitrile gloves is visible in the background, inspecting a nearby control panel. The lighting is bright and clinical, emphasizing the contrast between the hot machinery and the cold cleaning water. No text.",
