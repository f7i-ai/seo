  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, photorealistic hero image of a modern industrial manufacturing floor. In the foreground, a diverse team of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are standing near a large, well-maintained industrial pump system. They are all wearing full PPE: white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility neon vests over work shirts. One professional is holding a rugged industrial tablet, showing only the back of the device. The lighting is bright and professional, highlighting the clean, organized environment of a high-tech factory. The background shows blurred machinery and yellow safety railings, conveying a sense of scale and operational excellence. No text or logos are visible. Full-body or three-quarter shots of the people.",
