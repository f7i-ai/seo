  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers and maintenance technicians (wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests) are gathered around a large industrial pump system. One engineer is holding a tablet (back of device visible only) pointing toward the machine, implying digital scanning or augmented reality interaction. The background shows a busy, clean factory floor with blurred motion of conveyors and robotic arms. The lighting is professional and cool-toned, highlighting the metallic textures of the machinery. No text or words should be visible in the image. The atmosphere conveys precision, technology, and teamwork.",
