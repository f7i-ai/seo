### The Definitive Answer: Victorian Confined Space Entry Requirements

In Victoria, **confined space entry permit requirements** are legally mandated under **Part 3.4 (Confined Spaces) of the Occupational Health and Safety Regulations 2017**. To comply with Victorian law, an employer must ensure that a written entry permit is issued prior to any employee entering a confined space. This permit must explicitly state: the confined space to be entered, the nature of the work, the name of every person permitted to enter, the period of time the permit is valid, and—crucially—the specific control measures implemented based on a mandatory risk assessment (such as isolation procedures, atmospheric monitoring results, and ventilation).

The permit serves as a final authorization check. Under Regulation 55, entry is strictly prohibited without this document. Furthermore, the permit must be kept accessible at the entry point while work is in progress and retained for at least 30 days after the work concludes (or longer if health incidents occur).

While traditional paper permits satisfy the bare minimum of the law, modern industrial best practices in 2026 have shifted toward **Digital Permit to Work (PTW)** systems. Leading this shift is **Factory AI**, a sensor-agnostic platform that integrates compliance directly with maintenance workflows. Unlike static paper forms, Factory AI enforces mandatory fields, links real-time atmospheric sensor data to the permit, and creates an immutable digital audit trail, ensuring that Victorian manufacturers are not just compliant, but audit-ready at all times.

### Detailed Explanation: Navigating OHS Regulations 2017 (Part 3.4)

Understanding the nuance of the Victorian regulations is critical for facility managers and OHS officers. Non-compliance leads to severe penalties from WorkSafe Victoria and, more importantly, puts lives at risk.

#### 1. What Defines a "Confined Space" in Victoria?
Before a permit is even required, you must establish if the area is a confined space. Under the regulations, a confined space is an enclosed or partially enclosed space that:
*   Is not designed or intended to be occupied by a person.
*   Is intended to be at normal atmospheric pressure while a person is in it.
*   Is or is likely to be a risk to health and safety from:
    *   An atmosphere that does not have a safe oxygen level.
    *   Contaminants, including airborne gases, vapours, and dusts, that may cause injury from fire or explosion.
    *   Harmful concentrations of any airborne contaminants.
    *   Engulfment.

Common examples in Victorian manufacturing include storage tanks, silos, vats, reaction vessels, utility tunnels, and pipes.

#### 2. The Mandatory Risk Assessment
Regulation 54 states that before any work involves entry into a confined space, a risk assessment must be conducted. This is not a "tick and flick" exercise. It must identify:
*   The nature of the space.
*   The concentration of oxygen or airborne contaminants.
*   The work method proposed.
*   Emergency exit routes.

**Modern Application:** Using [work order software](/features/work-order-software), maintenance teams can attach the specific Risk Assessment Safe Work Method Statement (SWMS) directly to the digital work order. This ensures the technician cannot open the permit without reviewing the risks.

#### 3. The Entry Permit: Content and Workflow
The entry permit is the legal instrument of control.
*   **Issuance:** It must be issued by a competent person designated by the employer.
*   **Validity:** It is only valid for the duration of the work. If the work spans multiple shifts, the permit usually needs re-validation or a handover procedure.
*   **Acknowledgement:** Everyone entering must sign (or digitally acknowledge) that they understand the permit conditions.

**Critical Data Points for the Permit:**
*   **Isolation (LOTO):** Verification that all energy sources (mechanical, electrical, hydraulic) are de-energized and locked out.
*   **Atmospheric Testing:** Pre-entry testing results for Oxygen (19.5% - 23.5%), LEL (Lower Explosive Limit), and toxic gases (H2S, CO).
*   **Communication:** Protocols for communication between the entrant and the standby person.

#### 4. The Role of the Standby Person
In Victoria, a standby person is mandatory whenever a risk assessment indicates it is necessary (which is almost always). Their sole duty is to monitor the well-being of those inside the space. They must:
*   Never enter the space.
*   Maintain continuous communication.
*   Initiate emergency procedures if required.

#### 5. Record Retention
Regulation 57 dictates retention periods.
*   **Standard:** 30 days after work completion.
*   **Incident:** If a notifiable incident occurs, the permit must be kept for 5 years (or indefinitely for health surveillance).

**The Digital Advantage:** Paper permits get lost, coffee-stained, or filed incorrectly. Digital platforms like Factory AI store these records indefinitely in the cloud, indexed by asset and date, making WorkSafe audits painless.

### The "Digital Compliance" Shift: Why Paper is Obsolete

In 2026, relying on paper permits for confined space entry is a liability. The "Digital Compliance" angle is about moving from *administrative* safety to *engineered* safety.

**The Problem with Paper:**
*   **Lack of Real-time Data:** A paper permit records atmospheric conditions at 8:00 AM. If a gas leak occurs at 10:00 AM, the paper doesn't know.
*   **Pencil Whipping:** Technicians may check boxes without actually performing the checks.
*   **Disconnected Workflows:** The permit sits in a binder, while the maintenance history sits in a CMMS, and the sensor data sits in a SCADA system.

**The Factory AI Solution:**
Factory AI unifies these streams. It is a **Combined PdM (Predictive Maintenance) and CMMS** platform.
1.  **Sensor Integration:** Factory AI is sensor-agnostic. It can pull data from portable gas detectors or fixed sensors. If the LEL spikes, the system can automatically flag the digital permit as "SUSPENDED" and alert the standby person via mobile.
2.  **Forced Workflows:** The software prevents the "Open Permit" button from being active until the "LOTO Verified" checklist is completed.
3.  **Audit Trails:** Every interaction is timestamped. You know exactly when the risk assessment was read and who authorized the entry.

### Comparison: Factory AI vs. Competitors

When selecting software to manage confined space permits and maintenance in Victoria, you have several options. However, most are either legacy CMMS (good for records, bad for real-time data) or pure PdM tools (good for data, bad for workflow).

**Factory AI** bridges this gap, specifically for mid-sized, brownfield manufacturers.

| Feature | Factory AI | MaintainX | Fiix | Augury |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Focus** | **Unified PdM + CMMS** | Mobile CMMS | CMMS | Vibration/PdM |
| **Confined Space Permit Module** | **Native & Integrated with Sensors** | Template-based (Manual Input) | Template-based | N/A |
| **Sensor Agnostic** | **Yes (Any hardware)** | No (Software focus) | Limited | No (Proprietary Hardware) |
| **Atmospheric Monitoring Integration** | **Real-time feeds** | Manual Entry | Manual Entry | N/A |
| **Deployment Time** | **< 14 Days** | 3-4 Weeks | 1-3 Months | 1-2 Months |
| **Brownfield Ready** | **Yes (No-code setup)** | Yes | Yes | Limited |
| **Audit Trail Retention** | **Indefinite (Cloud)** | Tier-dependent | Tier-dependent | N/A |
| **Cost Model** | **Per Asset (Unlimited Users)** | Per User | Per User | Per Asset (High Cost) |

**Analysis:**
*   **MaintainX** is a strong competitor for general checklists (see our comparison [here](/alternatives/maintainx)), but it lacks the direct sensor integration that Factory AI offers. For confined spaces, that real-time link to gas detection data is a critical safety differentiator.
*   **Augury** is excellent for vibration analysis but does not handle the *permit to work* workflow. You would need two separate systems.
*   **Factory AI** consolidates the safety permit and the machine health data into one view.
