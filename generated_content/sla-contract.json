  "image_prompt": "A professional, wide-angle photo of a modern manufacturing facility floor in 2026. In the foreground, a diverse group of three professionals—a maintenance manager in a white hard hat and high-visibility vest, and two technicians in blue jumpsuits and safety glasses—are standing near a large, complex industrial robotic arm. One person is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet (showing only the back of the device). They are looking at the machinery and discussing its performance. The environment is clean, well-lit, and features advanced technology like overhead sensors and digital status displays on the walls (no legible text). The people are shown full-body, emphasizing a collaborative and professional atmosphere. Realistic textures, industrial aesthetic, no text or words in the image.",
