  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern, high-tech manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of three engineers (one female, two male) are wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. They are standing around a large industrial turbine. One engineer is pointing at a ruggedized edge server rack mounted directly next to the machine, while another holds a tablet (back of tablet visible only). In the background, blurred slightly to create depth, are automated conveyor belts and robotic arms. The lighting is a mix of cool industrial blue LED strips and warm ambient factory lighting. No text or holograms. The atmosphere conveys serious, professional industrial operations.",
