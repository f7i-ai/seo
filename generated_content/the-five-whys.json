  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, photo-realistic wide shot of a modern industrial manufacturing floor. In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are standing near a large, complex piece of machinery. They are wearing clean, professional PPE including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility yellow vests over work shirts. One technician is pointing toward a specific component of the machine while the others look on intently, engaged in a collaborative discussion. One person is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet, but only the back of the device is visible to the camera. The lighting is bright and clean, emphasizing a well-maintained, high-tech facility. The background shows other machinery and safety yellow floor markings, slightly out of focus to keep the emphasis on the team. No text or logos are visible. Full body shots of the professionals.",
