  "image_prompt": "A professional, photo-realistic wide shot of a modern industrial storeroom. In the foreground, a diverse team of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are collaborating. They are wearing clean, high-visibility vests, hard hats, and safety glasses. One person is pointing toward a neatly organized rack of industrial motors and gearboxes, while another holds a tablet (shown from the back, no screen visible). The background shows high-density shelving with labeled bins and large spare parts, illuminated by bright, clean LED warehouse lighting. The atmosphere is organized, efficient, and technologically advanced. Full-body shots of the workers, showing appropriate PPE and industrial footwear. No text or logos on the equipment.",
