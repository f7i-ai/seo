  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot of a large-scale open-pit mining operation in the Australian outback (red earth, blue sky). In the foreground, a modern, heavy-duty conveyor belt system transports iron ore. Two reliability engineers, one male and one female, are standing near the conveyor structure performing a visual inspection. They are wearing full mining PPE: high-visibility orange shirts with reflective strips, hard hats, safety glasses, and gloves. The female engineer is holding a ruggedized tablet (back of device visible only) as if checking data. The background shows the vastness of the mine with haul trucks in the distance. The lighting is golden hour, emphasizing the industrial scale and the harsh but beautiful environment. No text or overlays.",
