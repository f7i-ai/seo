  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern, clean manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance technicians (men and women) wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests are gathered around a large industrial pump. One technician is holding a ruggedized tablet, showing the back of the device to the camera (screen hidden), while pointing at a specific component on the machine. The lighting is professional and slightly cool, emphasizing a high-tech environment. In the background, blurred automated conveyor belts and robotic arms are visible. No text or holographic overlays in the air; the technology should look grounded and realistic for the year 2026.",
