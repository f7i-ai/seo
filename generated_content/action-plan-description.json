  "image_prompt": "A wide-angle, photo-realistic shot of a modern, clean industrial manufacturing floor. In the foreground, a diverse team of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are standing near a large, complex piece of machinery. They are all wearing full PPE, including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility orange vests over work shirts. One technician is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet, but only the back of the device is visible to the camera. They are pointing toward a specific section of the machine, appearing to discuss a strategy. The lighting is bright and professional, highlighting the metallic textures of the equipment and the clean, polished concrete floor. No text or digital screens are visible. Full-body view of the professionals.",
