In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance technicians (men and women, various ethnicities) are gathered around a large industrial pump. They are wearing modern PPE including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One technician is holding a ruggedized tablet, showing the back of the device, pointing at a specific component on the machine while referencing the screen. Another technician is holding a thermal imaging camera. The background is slightly blurred but shows high-tech automated machinery and soft, cool LED lighting typical of a smart factory.
