They are wearing full professional PPE, including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility neon vests over work uniforms. One technician is standing near a large, complex stainless steel pump assembly, while another is holding a professional handheld calibration device (showing only the back of the device). The third technician is looking at a tablet (back of the tablet visible). The lighting is bright and professional, highlighting the clean, organized nature of a top-tier facility. No text or logos are visible on the equipment or clothing. Full-body shots showing the scale of the industrial machinery.",
