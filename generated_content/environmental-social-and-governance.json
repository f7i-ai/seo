In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are standing near a large, well-maintained industrial motor and pump assembly. They are wearing clean, professional PPE including white hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One person is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet (showing only the back of the device). The background shows a bright, organized factory floor with solar tubes providing natural light and digital displays on the walls showing green energy metrics. No text or words are visible on any screens or walls. The lighting is bright and optimistic, emphasizing a \"green\" industrial future. Full body shots of the professionals.",
