  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, photo-realistic professional photograph of a modern industrial manufacturing floor. In the foreground, a large, clean industrial induction machine (electric motor) is the focal point. Two maintenance professionals—one man and one woman of diverse backgrounds—are standing near the machine. They are wearing full PPE, including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility orange vests over work shirts. One professional is pointing toward the motor's bearing housing while the other holds a ruggedized industrial tablet (viewed from the back, showing a sturdy black case, no screen content visible). The background shows a clean, well-lit factory environment with other machinery and yellow safety railings, slightly out of focus to emphasize the induction machine. The lighting is bright and natural, conveying a sense of advanced technology and safety. No text or logos are visible on the equipment or clothing.",
