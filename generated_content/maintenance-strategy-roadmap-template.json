In the foreground, a diverse group of three professionals (a maintenance manager in a white hard hat, a technician in a blue hard hat, and a data analyst holding a tablet) are looking at a large digital holographic display projected from a machine. The display shows a 3D \"roadmap\" visualization with nodes connecting assets, data points, and efficiency metrics. The background shows blurred automated machinery and conveyor belts. The lighting is industrial but warm, highlighting the collaboration and technology. The people are wearing safety glasses and high-visibility vests.
