  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, cinematic shot inside a modern manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers (wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests) are inspecting a large industrial conveyor system. One engineer is pointing at a specific component. In the background, slightly out of focus, a ruggedized orange industrial smart camera is mounted on a beam, with a green LED status light glowing, clearly monitoring the same machinery. The lighting is a mix of cool industrial LED and warm accent lighting. No text or screens visible. 8k resolution, highly detailed textures.",
