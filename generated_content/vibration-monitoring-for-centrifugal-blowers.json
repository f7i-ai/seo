  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-quality image inside a modern industrial manufacturing facility. The focus is on a large, blue industrial centrifugal blower connected to silver ductwork. A reliability engineer (diverse female, mid-30s) wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-visibility vest is inspecting the blower. She is holding a tablet in one hand (back of tablet visible) and pointing a thermal imaging camera or vibration sensor tool at the blower's bearing housing with the other. The background is slightly blurred but shows other machinery and yellow safety walkways. The lighting is bright and professional, emphasizing a clean, high-tech maintenance environment.
