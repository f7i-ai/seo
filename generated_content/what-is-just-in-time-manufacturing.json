In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are standing near a large industrial motor and conveyor system. They are wearing appropriate PPE, including white hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One person is holding a rugged industrial tablet, showing only the back of the device to the camera. The background shows a well-organized production line with Kanban signaling lights (green and amber).
