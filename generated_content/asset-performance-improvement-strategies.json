In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance professionals (men and women) are wearing full PPE including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One technician is holding a tablet device, showing the back of the device (no screen visible), appearing to scan a large industrial motor or pump. In the background, blurred slightly to emphasize the people, are automated conveyor belts and clean, high-tech machinery. The lighting is bright and professional, suggesting a \"Smart Factory\" environment. No text or words should be visible in the image.",
