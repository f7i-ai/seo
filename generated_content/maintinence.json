  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, photo-realistic hero image of a modern industrial manufacturing floor in 2026. In the foreground, a diverse team of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are collaborating. They are wearing clean, professional PPE including white hard hats, high-visibility vests, and safety glasses. One technician is pointing toward a large, complex robotic assembly arm, while another holds a rugged industrial tablet (showing only the back of the device). The environment is brightly lit, clean, and organized, featuring advanced machinery and subtle digital interfaces integrated into the factory walls. The focus is on the professional collaboration and the high-tech atmosphere of modern maintenance. No text or words should be visible in the image. Full-body or three-quarter shots to show the scale of the facility.",
