  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-resolution hero image inside a modern manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of industrial workers (men and women) are gathered for a toolbox talk. They are wearing full PPE including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One worker, a site supervisor, is holding a ruggedized tablet (back of device visible only) and gesturing towards a large industrial machine in the background.
