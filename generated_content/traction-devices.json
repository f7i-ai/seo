  "image_prompt": "A professional, photo-realistic wide shot of a modern industrial loading dock during a light winter dusting. In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (two men, one woman) are conducting a safety briefing. They are wearing full PPE: high-visibility orange vests, white hard hats, and safety glasses. One worker is demonstrating the proper fit of a high-quality industrial traction device (ice cleat) over a heavy-duty work boot; the worker is holding the boot up slightly, showing the underside of the traction device. A second worker is holding a ruggedized tablet (showing only the back of the device) to log the inspection. In the background, a forklift with visible tire chains is parked near a stack of pallets. The lighting is bright and professional, emphasizing a culture of safety and proactive maintenance. No text or logos.",
