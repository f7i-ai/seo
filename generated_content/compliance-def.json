  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, professional hero image of a modern manufacturing floor. In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (two men, one woman) are standing near a large industrial motor and conveyor system. They are wearing clean, appropriate PPE including white hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility yellow vests. One technician is pointing toward a specific component of the machinery while the others look on, engaged in a collaborative discussion. One person is holding a tablet, but only the back of the device is visible to the camera. The background shows a well-lit, organized factory environment with various pipes, sensors, and industrial equipment, conveying a sense of high-tech efficiency and strict safety compliance. The lighting is bright and natural, and the overall composition is clean and authoritative. No text or words appear in the image. Full-body shots of the professionals are shown.",
