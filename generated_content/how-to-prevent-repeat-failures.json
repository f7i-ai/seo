The engineer is wearing a hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-visibility vest, holding a rugged tablet that displays a complex vibration analysis graph and a 3D model of a gearbox. In the background, a clean, well-lit production line is visible with various sensors attached to the motors. The scene conveys a sense of precision, data-driven decision-making, and advanced industrial technology. No text.",
