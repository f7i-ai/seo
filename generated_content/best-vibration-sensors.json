  "image_prompt": "A high-quality, photorealistic image of a modern, clean manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse team of two maintenance professionals, one woman with dark hair in a ponytail and one man with a beard, both wearing safety glasses, hard hats, and high-visibility vests, are looking at a tablet. The tablet screen shows a clear graph of a vibration FFT spectrum. In the background, slightly out of focus, is a large, complex piece of industrial machinery like a CNC machine or a robotic arm, indicating the context of their work. The lighting is bright and professional. The image should convey collaboration, technology, and expertise. No text on the image.",
