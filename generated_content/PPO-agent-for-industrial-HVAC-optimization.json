  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, wide-angle shot inside a modern, high-tech industrial chiller plant. The scene is clean and metallic, dominated by large pipes (insulated in silver and blue) and massive centrifugal chillers. In the foreground, a diverse group of two engineers (one male, one female) wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests are looking at a tablet held by the female engineer (we see the back of the tablet, not the screen). They are gesturing toward a large digital gauge on a pipe. The lighting is cool and professional, with a subtle blue hue suggesting advanced technology. No text or overlays in the image.
