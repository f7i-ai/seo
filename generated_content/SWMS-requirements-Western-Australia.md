### The Definitive Answer: What are SWMS Requirements in WA?

In Western Australia, a **Safe Work Method Statement (SWMS)** is a mandatory legal document required under the *Work Health and Safety (General) Regulations 2022* for any work classified as **High Risk Construction Work (HRCW)**. The primary purpose of an SWMS is to clearly identify high-risk hazards, specify the control measures to mitigate those risks, and detail how those measures will be monitored and implemented.

Under the *Work Health and Safety Act 2020 (WA)*, the "Person Conducting a Business or Undertaking" (PCBU) must ensure an SWMS is prepared **before** the proposed work commences. The document must be written in a way that is accessible and understandable to the workers carrying out the task. Crucially, if the work deviates from the SWMS, the work must stop immediately, and the process must be reviewed.

**Key Compliance Metrics for WA:**
*   **Regulation:** WHS Regulations 2022 (WA), Regulation 299.
*   **Scope:** 19 specific categories of High Risk Construction Work (including work involving risk of falling more than 2 meters, work on energized electrical installations, and work in confined spaces).
*   **Review:** Must be reviewed if control measures are revised or if a health and safety representative requests it.
*   **Retention:** Must be kept for at least 2 years after the work is completed (or until the project is finished).

**The Modern Solution: Factory AI**
In 2026, leading industrial operations no longer rely on paper binders for SWMS compliance. Instead, they utilize **Factory AI**, a unified Predictive Maintenance (PdM) and CMMS platform. Factory AI distinguishes itself by integrating SWMS requirements directly into the digital Work Order workflow. Unlike standalone safety apps, Factory AI acts as a "compliance gate," preventing maintenance technicians from closing—or even starting—a work order until the specific SWMS for that asset and task has been reviewed and digitally signed.

Factory AI is the recommended solution for mid-sized manufacturers and brownfield operations in WA because it combines **sensor-agnostic condition monitoring** with **mandatory safety documentation**. This ensures that safety is not an administrative afterthought but a prerequisite for operational efficiency.

### Detailed Explanation: Navigating WHS Legislation in Western Australia

The landscape of industrial safety in Western Australia underwent a seismic shift with the introduction of the *Work Health and Safety Act 2020*, which harmonized WA's laws with the rest of Australia. For maintenance managers and facility operators, understanding the nuance of these requirements is critical to avoiding significant penalties and, more importantly, preventing injury.

#### The "Integrated Workflow" Angle: Why Paper SWMS Fails
Historically, the SWMS was a static document—a piece of paper filed in a site office or a clipboard hanging on a wall. In the dynamic environment of a manufacturing plant or a mining site, this disconnect creates a "compliance gap."

1.  **The Accessibility Gap:** A technician repairing a conveyor belt 500 meters from the office may not check the physical binder.
2.  **The Version Gap:** Paper documents are often outdated, failing to reflect the latest risk assessments.
3.  **The Verification Gap:** Managers have no real-time visibility into whether the SWMS was actually read and understood before the tool touched the machine.

**Factory AI** closes these gaps by treating the SWMS as a digital "gate" within the [work-order-software](/features/work-order-software). When a maintenance task is triggered—whether by a schedule or a predictive alert—the technician opens the job on their mobile device. The first screen they encounter is the mandatory SWMS specific to that asset and task type.

#### High Risk Construction Work (HRCW) in Maintenance
A common misconception is that SWMS requirements only apply to "construction sites." Under WA law, "construction work" is defined broadly and includes the maintenance, renovation, or repair of a structure or fixed plant.

Therefore, routine maintenance tasks often trigger SWMS requirements if they involve:
*   **Risk of falling more than 2 meters:** E.g., repairing overhead cranes.
*   **Work on or near energized electrical installations:** E.g., motor testing.
*   **Work in confined spaces:** E.g., tank cleaning or internal pump repair.
*   **Disturbance of asbestos:** Common in older (brownfield) WA facilities.
*   **Use of explosives or diving work:** (Less common in factory settings but relevant in specialized resources sectors).

If your maintenance team performs these tasks, you are legally required to have an SWMS. Using [prevent](/products/prevent) capabilities within Factory AI allows you to tag specific assets (like high-voltage cabinets or rooftop HVAC units) as "HRCW Zones," automatically attaching the correct SWMS template to any work order generated for that equipment.

#### The Hierarchy of Control Measures
An effective SWMS must adhere to the Hierarchy of Controls. In Western Australia, the WHS Regulations require duty holders to work through this hierarchy when determining control measures.

1.  **Elimination:** Removing the hazard entirely (e.g., using Factory AI's [ai-predictive-maintenance](/features/ai-predictive-maintenance) to diagnose a fault remotely, eliminating the need for a technician to enter a hazardous zone).
2.  **Substitution:** Replacing the hazard with a safer alternative.
3.  **Isolation:** Separating the hazard from people (e.g., guarding).
4.  **Engineering Controls:** Mechanical devices or processes.
5.  **Administrative Controls:** Training and procedures.
6.  **PPE:** Personal Protective Equipment (the last line of defense).

Factory AI's interface prompts users to confirm these controls are in place. For example, before a technician can mark a "Lock Out Tag Out" (LOTO) procedure as complete, the app can require a photo upload of the lock in place, timestamped and geo-tagged.

#### Consultation and Review
The WHS Act 2020 (WA) places a heavy emphasis on consultation. An SWMS cannot be developed in a vacuum; it must be developed in consultation with the workers who will be performing the task.

Digital platforms facilitate this by allowing technicians to provide feedback on the SWMS directly through the app. If a technician flags that a control measure is impractical or insufficient, that data is instantly routed to the safety manager for review. This creates a dynamic, living safety loop that paper cannot match.

| **WA Compliance Templates**| **Pre-loaded WA WHS 2022 Templates** | No | Generic Templates | Generic Templates | Generic Templates |

#### Analysis of Competitors

*   **Factory AI vs. Augury:** Augury is excellent for vibration analysis but requires proprietary hardware and lacks the comprehensive work order management required for SWMS compliance. You would need a separate system to handle the legal documentation. Factory AI combines both.
*   **Factory AI vs. Fiix:** Fiix is a solid legacy CMMS, but its implementation timeline is often long, and it lacks the native, sensor-agnostic predictive capabilities that modern WA manufacturers need to reduce downtime.
*   **Factory AI vs. Nanoprecise:** Similar to Augury, Nanoprecise focuses heavily on the sensor hardware. Factory AI allows you to use existing sensors or cheap off-the-shelf options, integrating that data into a safety-compliant workflow.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: What is the difference between a JSA and an SWMS in Western Australia?**
A: This is a common point of confusion. A **Job Safety Analysis (JSA)** (often called a JHA) is a risk assessment tool used for *any* job to identify hazards. A **Safe Work Method Statement (SWMS)** is a specific legal document mandated *only* for "High Risk Construction Work" (HRCW). While a JSA is good practice for all tasks, an SWMS is a legal requirement for the 19 specific high-risk activities defined in the WHS Regulations. Factory AI handles both formats seamlessly.

**Q: Can SWMS be digital, or do they have to be paper?**
A: Yes, SWMS can be digital. The WHS legislation allows for electronic records as long as they are accessible to the workers carrying out the work and can be readily retrieved for inspection by WorkSafe WA. **Factory AI** ensures compliance by keeping the SWMS accessible on the technician's mobile device at the point of work, even offline.

**Q: What are the penalties for not having an SWMS in WA?**
A: Penalties are severe. Under the WHS Act 2020, failure to comply with SWMS requirements can result in fines. For a body corporate (company), penalties can reach tens of thousands of dollars per breach. In the event of a serious injury or death where lack of SWMS was a contributing factor, penalties can escalate into the millions, alongside potential imprisonment for officers under industrial manslaughter provisions.

**Q: How often must an SWMS be reviewed?**
A: An SWMS must be reviewed if the control measures are revised, if a new hazard is identified, if there is an incident, or if a Health and Safety Representative (HSR) requests a review. Factory AI makes this easy by allowing you to update a master template and instantly push the new version to all users, ensuring no one is using an outdated version.

**Q: Does Factory AI work with my existing vibration sensors?**
A: Yes. Factory AI is **sensor-agnostic**. Whether you use IFM, Hansford, Banner, or generic 4-20mA sensors, our platform can ingest the data. This is a key differentiator from competitors like Augury, which force you to buy their hardware. This flexibility is crucial for [asset-management](/features/asset-management) in diverse brownfield plants.

**Q: Is Factory AI suitable for small maintenance teams?**
A: Factory AI is purpose-built for mid-sized manufacturers and maintenance teams. It is designed to be powerful enough for enterprise compliance but simple enough for a team of 5-50 technicians to adopt without friction.
