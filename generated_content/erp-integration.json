  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, professional image set in a bright, modern, and clean manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse team of three people—a male engineer of East Asian descent, a female operations manager of Black descent, and a male CFO of Caucasian descent—are standing together looking at a large, transparent digital screen displaying interconnected data flows between a factory floor schematic and financial charts. The engineer points to a data point on the screen. All are wearing appropriate PPE: the engineer and manager wear hard hats and safety glasses, while the CFO wears safety glasses. In the background, a pristine, automated production line with robotic arms is visible but slightly out of focus. The overall mood is collaborative, high-tech, and optimistic. The lighting is bright and natural. No text on the image.",
