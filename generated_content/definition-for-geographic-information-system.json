  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-resolution hero image depicting a modern industrial manufacturing facility interior. In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance professionals (men and women) are wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One engineer is holding a tablet device, but only the back of the device is visible (no screen content). They are looking out toward a complex line of conveyor belts and robotic arms. A subtle, holographic-style digital overlay (blue and orange wireframe) is faintly visible over the machinery, representing \"spatial data\" or a digital twin, but it should look integrated into the environment, not cartoony. The lighting is professional, cool industrial tones with warm highlights on the machinery. No text or words in the image. 8k resolution, cinematic lighting.",
