  "image_prompt": "A high-quality, photorealistic image set in a bright, modern manufacturing facility. A female maintenance manager of color and a younger male Caucasian technician are standing side-by-side, looking at a tablet the manager is holding. The tablet screen shows colorful graphs and data visualizations. Both are wearing safety glasses and high-visibility vests over their professional work attire. In the background, slightly out of focus, is a sophisticated piece of industrial machinery like a robotic arm or a clean, modern conveyor system. The overall mood is collaborative, professional, and tech-forward. No text on the image.",
