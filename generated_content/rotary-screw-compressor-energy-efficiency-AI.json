  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern industrial compressor room. In the foreground, a reliability engineer wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-visibility vest is inspecting a large, industrial rotary screw compressor. The engineer is holding a tablet (screen not visible) and looking at a wireless sensor mounted on the side of the compressor motor. The background shows a row of large blue and grey compressors with yellow piping systems overhead. The lighting is cool industrial LED with a slight blue hue, emphasizing a clean, high-tech manufacturing environment. No text or words in the image. 8k resolution.",
