In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers (men and women) wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests are gathered around a large industrial motor. One engineer is pointing at a wireless sensor mounted on the motor, while another holds a tablet (back of tablet visible only) showing a data graph. The background shows a busy, clean production line with conveyors and automated machinery. The lighting is bright and industrial, highlighting the \"Glass Box\" transparency concept with clear sightlines. No text or overlays in the image.",
