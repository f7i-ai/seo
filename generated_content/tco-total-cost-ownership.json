  "image_prompt": "A high-end, photo-realistic wide shot of a modern 2026 industrial manufacturing floor. In the foreground, a diverse group of three professionals—a female maintenance manager in a white hard hat and high-visibility vest, and two male technicians in blue coveralls and safety glasses—are standing near a large, clean robotic assembly arm. They are engaged in a serious professional discussion. One technician is holding a rugged industrial tablet, but we only see the back of the device, not the screen. The background shows a clean, well-lit facility with automated guided vehicles (AGVs) moving in the distance and organized workstations. Everyone is wearing appropriate PPE, including hard hats, safety glasses, and steel-toed boots. The lighting is bright and natural, emphasizing a high-tech, efficient atmosphere. No text or logos are visible. Full-body shots of the people.",
