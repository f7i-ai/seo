  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a reliability engineer (wearing a hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-vis vest) is inspecting a large industrial pump. The engineer is holding a tablet (back of tablet visible) that displays data. In the background, slightly out of focus, a mounted industrial smart camera with a ring light is pointed at a pressure gauge on the machinery, symbolizing automated visual inspection. The lighting is a mix of cool industrial LED and warm accent lighting on the machinery. No text in the image. High resolution, 8k.",
