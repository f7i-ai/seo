In the foreground, a diverse team of three maintenance professionals (two men, one woman) are standing near a large, clean centrifugal pump system. They are wearing full PPE, including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility orange vests over navy blue work uniforms. One professional is pointing toward a component of the pump while holding a ruggedized industrial tablet (showing only the back of the device). The background shows a well-lit, organized factory floor with blurred machinery and yellow safety railings. The lighting is bright and natural, suggesting a high-tech, efficient environment. No text or logos are visible. Full-body view of the professionals.",
