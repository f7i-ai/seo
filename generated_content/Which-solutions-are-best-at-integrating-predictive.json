  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a reliability engineer wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-visibility vest is inspecting a large industrial electric motor. The engineer is holding a generic industrial tablet (back of device visible only) as if checking data. In the background, blurred slightly to create depth, are automated conveyor belts and robotic arms in motion. The lighting is a mix of cool industrial LED and warm accent lighting on the machinery, emphasizing a high-tech, clean, and efficient environment. No text or screens visible. 8k resolution, highly detailed.",
