  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, professional photo of a modern manufacturing floor. In the foreground, a diverse team of two maintenance professionals (one male, one female) are collaborating. They are wearing clean, appropriate PPE: white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility yellow vests over work shirts. One professional is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet, showing only the plain black back of the device to the camera. They are standing near a large, well-maintained industrial motor and pump assembly. The background shows a clean, organized factory environment with overhead conveyors and soft industrial lighting. The focus is sharp on the people and the machinery, conveying a sense of expertise, teamwork, and advanced technology. No text or logos are visible.
