  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-quality hero image set in a modern industrial manufacturing facility in Australia. The scene focuses on a confined space entry point (a large metal tank access hatch). A diverse group of safety professionals and maintenance technicians are present. One technician, wearing a high-visibility orange vest, hard hat, and safety glasses, is kneeling near the hatch holding a yellow handheld gas detector (back of device visible) attached to a sampling hose extending into the tank. Another technician stands nearby holding a tablet (screen not visible) to log the data. A standby person is positioned alertly with a communication radio. The lighting is industrial but bright, emphasizing safety and precision. No text or words should be visible in the image.",
