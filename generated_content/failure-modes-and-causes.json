In the foreground, a reliability engineer (wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-vis vest) is inspecting a large industrial centrifugal pump. They are holding a ruggedized tablet, viewing a 3D digital twin model of the pump on the screen (screen content visible but not text-heavy). In the background, out of focus, other technicians in blue uniforms are working on a conveyor line. The lighting is a mix of cool industrial LED and warm amber warning lights, creating a professional, serious atmosphere. No text overlays. 8k resolution.",
