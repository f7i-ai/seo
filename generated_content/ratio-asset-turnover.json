  "image_prompt": "A high-end, photo-realistic wide shot of a modern industrial manufacturing floor. In the foreground, a diverse group of three professionals—a maintenance manager in a navy blue work shirt and a female plant engineer in a high-visibility vest—are standing near a large, well-maintained industrial pump system. They are all wearing white hard hats and clear safety glasses. One person is holding a rugged industrial tablet, but only the back of the device is visible to the camera. The background shows a clean, organized \"brownfield\" factory setting with a mix of older green machinery and new stainless steel components. The lighting is bright and professional, emphasizing a productive and safe work environment. Full-body shots of the people, no text or screens visible.",
