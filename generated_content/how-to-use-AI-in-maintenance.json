A maintenance engineer in a clean uniform and safety gear is holding a tablet that displays a 3D digital twin of a large industrial motor. The tablet shows a glowing orange \"anomaly\" area on a bearing. In the background, the actual physical motor is equipped with small, sleek wireless IIoT sensors. The lighting is bright and professional, emphasizing a shift from greasy, reactive repair to data-driven reliability. No text on the screen.",
