In the foreground, a reliability engineer (wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-visibility vest) is inspecting a large, blue industrial centrifugal pump. The engineer is holding a tablet (back of tablet visible) looking at data. In the background, blurred slightly, are piping networks and a digital control panel with green status lights. The lighting is cool and professional, emphasizing a clean, high-tech industrial environment. No text overlays.",
