Capital is the collection of physical assets, financial resources, and infrastructure that an organization utilizes to generate value, produce goods, or provide services over an extended period. In an industrial or manufacturing context, capital primarily refers to "fixed assets"—the heavy machinery, production lines, facilities, and technology systems that appear on the balance sheet and provide utility beyond a single fiscal year.

### The Maintenance Manager’s Guide to Capital
For maintenance and facility managers in 2026, understanding the definition of capital is less about accounting and more about lifecycle strategy. While a technician sees a centrifugal pump as a piece of equipment to be lubricated, a manager sees it as a capital asset that must be preserved to maximize Return on Assets (ROA). 

The distinction between capital and operational expenses is critical for industrial decision-making. Capital Expenditure (CapEx) involves the funds used to acquire, upgrade, and physically maintain these long-term assets. Conversely, Operational Expenditure (OpEx) covers the day-to-day costs of keeping those assets running, such as labor, minor repairs, and consumables. 

In the modern "Financial Literacy for Engineers" framework, maintenance is no longer viewed as a "cost center" (OpEx drain) but as a "capital preservation" strategy. By implementing advanced [asset management](/features/asset-management) protocols, organizations can extend the useful life of their machinery, thereby delaying massive capital outlays for replacements and improving the company’s overall Net Present Value (NPV).

### Capital Assets and Depreciation
A defining characteristic of capital assets in a B2B environment is depreciation. Because these assets wear down over time, their value is "written off" over their useful life according to specific depreciation schedules. Maintenance teams play a direct role in this financial calculation; if a machine is neglected and fails three years before its projected end-of-life, it creates a "capital shortfall" that can disrupt a company's Capital Improvement Plan (CIP).

To manage this effectively, industrial leaders utilize [CMMS software](/products/cmms-software) to track the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO). This includes the initial purchase price (Capital), the cost of maintenance over time (OpEx), and the eventual salvage value. High-performing facilities use these data points to determine the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) for new equipment purchases, ensuring that every dollar of capital is deployed where it will generate the most significant industrial output.

According to standards set by organizations like the [National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)](https://www.nist.gov), the integration of digital twins and real-time monitoring is now a standard requirement for protecting industrial capital. By shifting toward [AI-driven predictive maintenance](/features/ai-predictive-maintenance), firms can ensure that their capital remains productive, avoiding the catastrophic "dead capital" scenarios caused by unplanned downtime.
