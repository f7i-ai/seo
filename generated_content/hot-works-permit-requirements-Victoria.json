In the foreground, a maintenance technician wearing full PPE (orange high-vis shirt, safety glasses, welding helmet raised, heavy gloves) is holding a tablet (back of device visible only) to complete a digital checklist. In the mid-ground, another technician is performing a welding task on a conveyor system with sparks flying, protected by a red fire-retardant welding screen.
