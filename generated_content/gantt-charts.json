  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot of a modern manufacturing facility control room. In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance planners and engineers (wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests) are gathered around a large, wall-mounted digital display. The display shows a sophisticated, glowing Gantt chart interface with dark mode styling, featuring blue and green timeline bars and red critical path indicators. One engineer is pointing at a specific section of the timeline. In the background, through a glass window, the blurred industrial plant floor is visible with machinery and pipes. The lighting is professional and cool-toned, emphasizing technology and precision. No text or words should be visible on the screens or walls.",
