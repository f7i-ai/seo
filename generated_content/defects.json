  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-resolution hero image inside a modern industrial manufacturing facility. The scene features a diverse group of maintenance engineers and plant managers (men and women of various ethnicities) wearing standard PPE including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. They are standing near a large industrial conveyor system and a heavy-duty motor. One engineer is holding a tablet device, but only the back of the device is visible (no screen content). They are looking at the machinery with a focused, professional expression, discussing a specific component. The lighting is cinematic and industrial, with a mix of natural light from high windows and cool LED plant lighting. No text or words should appear in the image. The atmosphere conveys reliability, technology, and proactive management.",
