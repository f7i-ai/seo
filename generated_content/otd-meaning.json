  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern, high-tech manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers and plant managers (wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests) are gathered around a large industrial machine. One engineer is pointing to a specific component on the machine, while another holds a tablet (back of tablet visible only) referencing data. The background shows a busy, clean production line with blurred motion of conveyors and automated arms, symbolizing speed and activity. The lighting is professional and industrial, with cool blue and warm amber tones highlighting the machinery. No text or words in the image. Focus on the collaboration and the technology.",
