  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, photo-realistic wide shot of a modern, clean industrial manufacturing floor. In the foreground, a diverse team of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are standing near a large, complex piece of machinery. They are wearing professional navy blue work uniforms, white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One technician is pointing toward a specific component of the machine while the others look on, engaged in a collaborative technical discussion. One person is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet, but only the back of the device is visible. The lighting is bright and natural, highlighting the polished concrete floor and the intricate piping and wiring of the equipment. There are no words, logos, or text visible in the image. Full-body shots of the professionals are shown to emphasize the scale of the industrial environment.",
