In the foreground, a diverse group of industrial maintenance professionals (men and women) are wearing safety gear (hard hats, safety glasses, high-vis vests). One technician is inspecting a large industrial motor, holding a tablet (back of device visible only) that implies data reading. In the background, blurred automated conveyor belts and robotic arms are in motion. The lighting is cool industrial blue with warm highlights on the machinery. No text or overlays in the image.
