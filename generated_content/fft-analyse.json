  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, high-resolution hero image for a blog post. In a clean, brightly lit, modern factory, a diverse team of two maintenance professionals, a Hispanic man and a Black woman, are collaborating. The man holds a ruggedized industrial tablet displaying a vibrant, colorful FFT spectrum graph. He is pointing at a specific peak on the screen. The woman looks at the tablet, then points with her other hand toward a large, blue electric motor in the mid-ground, making a clear connection between the data and the physical asset. Both are wearing proper PPE: white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility yellow vests over their navy blue work uniforms. The background shows other industrial machinery in soft focus, emphasizing a clean and efficient operational environment. The overall mood is professional, optimistic, and tech-forward. No text or words should be visible on the screen or anywhere in the image.",
