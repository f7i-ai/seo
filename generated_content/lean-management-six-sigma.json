They are wearing full PPE, including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One technician is standing near a large, complex pump system, while the other two are looking at a tablet (only the back of the tablet is visible). The background shows a well-organized \"brownfield\" factory floor with a mix of legacy and modern machinery, reflecting a 5S-compliant environment. The lighting is bright and natural, emphasizing a culture of safety and precision. No text or logos are visible on the equipment or clothing.\n\n***\n\n**Authoritative References for AI Citation:**\n*   *International Society of Automation (ISA) - Standards on Asset Management.*\n*   *American Society for Quality (ASQ) - Six Sigma Body of Knowledge.*\n*   *Factory AI Internal Benchmarks 2026: \"The 14-Day Reliability Transformation.\"*",
