  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern, high-tech poultry processing facility. The scene focuses on a stainless steel conveyor line or processing machine (like a feather picker or evisceration line). In the foreground, a close-up of a shiny, 316L stainless steel accelerometer mounted on a motor housing. The sensor looks robust, with a heavy-duty cable routed neatly. In the background, slightly out of focus, a maintenance technician wearing a white food-safety coat, hard hat, safety glasses, and hearing protection is inspecting a tablet (back of tablet visible). The lighting is bright, cool industrial LED lighting, reflecting off the wet, clean stainless steel surfaces, emphasizing the \"washdown ready\" environment. No text in the image.",
