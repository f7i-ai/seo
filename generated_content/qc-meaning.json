In the foreground, a diverse pair of maintenance professionals (one male, one female) are collaborating. They are wearing clean, professional PPE including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility yellow vests over work shirts. One professional is pointing toward a large, well-maintained industrial motor/pump assembly, while the other holds a rugged industrial tablet (shown from the back, no screen visible). The background shows a clean, organized \"brownfield\" factory environment with a mix of legacy piping and modern sensors. The lighting is bright and professional, conveying a sense of precision, technology, and reliability. Full-body or three-quarter shots of the people, no text or logos visible.",
