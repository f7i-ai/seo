In the foreground, a reliability engineer (wearing a hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-visibility vest) is viewed from behind or over-the-shoulder, holding a ruggedized industrial tablet. The tablet screen (blurred or showing abstract graphs) implies system configuration or data analysis. In the background, out of focus, diverse technicians are working on a complex automated assembly line with robotic arms and conveyor belts. The lighting is bright and industrial, with a cool blue and metallic color palette. No text or specific logos should be visible. The atmosphere conveys precision, technology, and industrial scale.",
