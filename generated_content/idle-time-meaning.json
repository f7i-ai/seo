  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, professional image for a manufacturing blog post. In a bright, clean, modern factory setting, a female maintenance manager of South Asian descent wearing a hard hat and safety glasses, and a male machine operator of Black descent wearing safety glasses and a hair net, stand together looking at a tablet. The tablet screen shows a graph with OEE data.

The lighting is bright and optimistic. No text on the image.",
