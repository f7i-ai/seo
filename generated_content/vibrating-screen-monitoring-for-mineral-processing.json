  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern mineral processing facility. In the foreground, a reliability engineer wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, and high-visibility vest is inspecting a large, yellow industrial vibrating screen. The engineer is holding a ruggedized tablet (back of tablet visible) while looking at the machinery. The vibrating screen is in operation, slightly blurred to suggest motion, with rocks/ore moving across the deck. In the background, conveyor belts and steel structures fade into the depth of the factory. The lighting is industrial but dramatic, highlighting the dust particles in the air and the scale of the equipment. No text or overlays.",
