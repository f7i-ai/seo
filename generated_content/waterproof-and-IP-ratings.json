  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-quality hero image inside a modern food and beverage manufacturing facility. The scene shows a diverse group of maintenance engineers (men and women) wearing white hygienic lab coats, hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. They are inspecting a stainless steel conveyor system that is glistening with water droplets, suggesting a recent washdown. One engineer is holding a rugged tablet (back facing the camera) while pointing at a sensor mounted on a motor. The background features clean, metallic industrial equipment with soft, professional lighting. No text or words in the image.
