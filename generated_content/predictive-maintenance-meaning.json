  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern, clean manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse maintenance technician (wearing safety glasses, a hard hat, and a high-visibility vest) is inspecting a large industrial electric motor. The technician is holding a tablet device (back of device visible) that displays a graph (representing a P-F curve or vibration data). In the background, slightly out of focus, are automated conveyor belts and other industrial machinery. The lighting is professional, with a mix of cool industrial blue tones and warm highlights on the machinery. The image conveys technology, safety, and precision. No text or words should be visible in the image.",
