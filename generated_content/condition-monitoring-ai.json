  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a reliability engineer (wearing a hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-visibility vest) is inspecting a large industrial electric motor. The engineer is holding a tablet, but we only see the back of the device, implying they are looking at data. In the background, slightly out of focus, is a clean, automated production line with conveyors and robotic arms. The lighting is professional, with a mix of cool industrial blue tones and warm accent lighting on the machinery. The image conveys a sense of high-tech precision and industrial scale.
