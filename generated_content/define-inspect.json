  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, high-definition image inside a modern manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance engineers (men and women) wearing standard PPE (hard hats, safety glasses, high-visibility vests) are gathered around a large industrial pump and motor assembly. One engineer is pointing at a wireless sensor mounted on the motor. Another engineer holds a tablet device, but only the back of the tablet is visible (no screen content). The background shows a clean, busy factory floor with blurred conveyor belts and automated machinery. The lighting is industrial but warm, highlighting the professionalism and technology integration. No text or words in the image. 16:9 aspect ratio.",
