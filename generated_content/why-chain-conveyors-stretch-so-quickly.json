  "image_prompt": "A high-detail, photo-realistic macro shot of an industrial roller chain on a sprocket. The image should show a maintenance technician in high-visibility gear and gloves using a precision caliper or chain wear gauge to measure the distance between pins. The background should be a clean but active manufacturing floor with soft-focus machinery. The lighting should highlight the metallic texture of the chain and the presence of a thin oil film.",
