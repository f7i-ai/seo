  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a large industrial manufacturing facility during a shutdown maintenance event. In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers and maintenance managers (wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-vis vests) are gathered around a large digital tablet held by one person (screen not visible to camera) and a physical blueprint table. They are in deep discussion, pointing at a specific section of the plant. In the background, blurred but visible, technicians are working on a large turbine or conveyor system with sparks flying from a welding operation. The lighting is dramatic, mixing cool industrial LED lighting with warm highlights from the maintenance work. The atmosphere conveys serious, high-stakes planning and precision.
