  "image_prompt": "A high-resolution, photo-realistic professional photograph of a modern industrial maintenance staging area. In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are wearing clean, high-visibility vests, hard hats, and safety glasses. They are standing near a heavy-duty industrial shelving unit where several organized \"kits\" (clear, durable bins containing mechanical parts like gears, bearings, and gaskets) are neatly arranged. One technician is holding a ruggedized tablet (showing only the back of the device) while pointing toward a specific kit. The background shows a well-lit, clean manufacturing floor with large-scale machinery, suggesting a high-tech \"brownfield\" environment. The lighting is bright and professional, emphasizing a sense of organized efficiency and safety. No text or logos are visible on any surfaces. Full-body shots of the professionals are shown.",
