  "image_prompt": "A photorealistic, professional image set in a clean, modern plastics manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a female maintenance manager of Hispanic descent and a male reliability engineer of Asian descent, both wearing safety glasses and company-branded polo shirts, are looking at a ruggedized tablet. The tablet screen displays colorful graphs and data visualizations, including a vibration spectrum and a thermal map. In the background, slightly out of focus, is a large, modern injection molding machine, well-lit and clearly visible. The overall mood is professional, high-tech, and collaborative.
