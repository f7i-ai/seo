In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers and maintenance managers (wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and reflective vests) are gathered around a large, futuristic holographic table display projecting 3D visualizations of factory machinery and floating data dashboards with graphs and \"traffic light\" status indicators.
