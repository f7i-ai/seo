  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot of a modern industrial rail siding at a manufacturing plant. In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers and logistics coordinators (men and women, various ethnicities) are wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. They are looking toward a line of freight railcars being loaded by a large industrial conveyor system. One engineer in the center is holding a tablet (back of device visible only) as if checking data. The lighting is golden hour, emphasizing the scale of the industrial infrastructure. The image conveys efficiency, safety, and the intersection of heavy transport and high-tech maintenance. No text or logos in the image.",
