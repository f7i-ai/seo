In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance engineers (men and women) wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests are gathered around a large industrial pump system. One engineer is pointing to a specific component on the machine, while another holds a tablet (showing only the back of the device) referencing data. The background shows blurred production lines and piping, emphasizing a \"brownfield\" industrial environment. The lighting is professional and dramatic, highlighting the complexity of the machinery and the focus of the team. No text or overlays.",
