  "image_prompt": "A professional photo-realistic scene in a modern 2026 industrial control room. A diverse group of three professionals—a female reliability engineer in a high-visibility vest and hard hat, a male maintenance manager in a navy work shirt, and a technician—are standing around a large, sleek industrial workstation. They are pointing at a complex data visualization on a large wall-mounted screen (the screen shows blurred charts and nodes, no legible text). The engineer is holding a rugged industrial tablet, but we only see the back of the device. Everyone is wearing appropriate PPE including safety glasses. The lighting is bright and clean, reflecting a high-tech manufacturing environment. The focus is on their collaborative interaction and professional demeanor. No text or logos visible. Full body or upper body shot.",
