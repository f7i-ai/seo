  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern industrial manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse team of maintenance technicians (wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-vis vests) is gathered around a large, complex piece of industrial machinery that has stopped. One technician is pointing at a specific component while holding a tablet (back of tablet visible only). Another technician is inspecting a panel with a multimeter. In the background, out of focus, a production manager looks on concerned but calm. The lighting is dramatic but professional, highlighting the \"Golden Hour\" urgency—perhaps slightly cooler blue tones from the factory lights mixed with warm task lighting on the machine. No text overlays. 16:9 aspect ratio.",
