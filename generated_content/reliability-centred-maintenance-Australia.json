  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern Australian manufacturing facility. The scene features a diverse group of reliability engineers and maintenance technicians (men and women) wearing high-visibility vests, hard hats, and safety glasses. They are standing near a large industrial conveyor system and a heavy-duty motor. One technician is holding a tablet device (viewed from the back, screen not visible) appearing to scan a machine, while an operations manager points toward the machinery, discussing a strategy. The lighting is professional and industrial, with a mix of cool factory lighting and warm highlights on the machinery. No text or overlays in the image. The atmosphere conveys efficiency, safety, and advanced technology integration.",
