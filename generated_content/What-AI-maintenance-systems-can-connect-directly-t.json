  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers (wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests) are standing near a large industrial control panel. One engineer is pointing to a small, sleek edge gateway device mounted on the DIN rail inside the open panel, while holding a tablet (back of tablet visible only). In the background, blurred automated conveyor belts and robotic arms are in motion. The lighting is industrial but warm, highlighting the integration of new technology with existing machinery. No text or words in the image. 8k resolution, highly detailed.",
