  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot of a modern open-cut coal mine in Queensland, Australia, during the \"golden hour\" of sunrise. In the foreground, a diverse group of three mining professionals (a Site Senior Executive, a Maintenance Manager, and a Safety Officer) are standing confidently. They are wearing full compliant PPE: high-visibility orange and yellow shirts with reflective strips, white hard hats, safety glasses, and steel-capped boots. The central figure is holding a ruggedized tablet, but the screen is not visible (showing the back of the device). In the background, out of focus but recognizable, are massive pieces of mining equipment—a dragline and a large haul truck. The atmosphere conveys safety, technology, and industrial scale. No text or overlays in the image.",
