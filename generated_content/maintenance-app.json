  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, professional image for a blog post about maintenance apps. A female maintenance manager of Hispanic descent and a male technician of Black descent are standing in a clean, modern manufacturing facility. They are both wearing safety glasses, high-visibility vests over their work clothes, and hard hats. The manager is holding a ruggedized tablet displaying a clean, modern user interface with charts and graphs, pointing to something on the screen. The technician is looking at the tablet and nodding, holding a smartphone in his other hand that shows a work order screen. In the background, a well-maintained industrial conveyor system is visible but slightly out of focus. The lighting is bright and professional, conveying a sense of efficiency and technology. There is no text on the image.",
