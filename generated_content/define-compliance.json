  "image_prompt": "A photo-realistic, high-resolution image of a modern industrial manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance engineers (men and women) are wearing safety gear including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One engineer is holding a tablet device, but only the back of the device is visible (no screen content). They are looking at a large, complex industrial machine, perhaps a conveyor system or large pump, appearing to discuss its operation. The background is a clean, well-lit factory floor with blurred machinery to emphasize the people. No text or words should appear in the image. The lighting should be professional and dynamic, highlighting the safety and modern nature of the environment.",
