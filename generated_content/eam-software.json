  "image_prompt": "A wide-angle, photo-realistic shot of a modern, high-tech manufacturing facility in 2026. In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (two men, one woman) are standing near a large, complex industrial robotic arm. They are wearing professional PPE, including white hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One professional is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet, showing only the back of the device. The lighting is bright and clean, with a slight blue-tinted industrial aesthetic. The background shows a clean, organized factory floor with other machinery and soft-focus activity. No text or logos are visible. Full body shots of the professionals.",
