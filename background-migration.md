Help me write a migration script to use the content generated by the seo content generator script in the @/generated_content directory and create the documents using the migrate API @https://prismic.io/docs/migration#providing-document-data 

I've stored the PRISMIC_API_KEY in my .env in the seo directory.

the repository is factory-ai
In each document I would like you to use the @/TitleAndBody  and @/ProfileTim  slices. The profileTim goes at the bottom.

For the images, you'll need to use the https://prismic.io/docs/asset-api-technical-reference Asset API.

You will need to install the dependencies.
"@prismicio/client": "latest",
"@prismicio/migrate": "latest"

After you have finished the migration script, please start creating documents for the generated content. Add the assets

The generated content is in markdown, but prismic only has a rich text field, so you'll need to find a way to copy the content over in the rendered markdown format.

You will need to come up with a suitable URI for each post, based on the title.
