2025-07-29 11:19:31,722 - INFO - Generating image with prompt: A photorealistic, high-quality image of a diverse team of three maintenance professionals in a clean, modern manufacturing facility. A woman with dark hair in a ponytail, a man of East Asian descent, and a Black man are gathered around a large industrial pump. The woman is holding a ruggedized tablet displaying colorful graphs and data (from a CMMS). She is pointing at the screen while the two men look on, engaged in a collaborative discussion, occasionally gesturing towards the pump. All are wearing appropriate PPE: blue hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests over their work uniforms. The lighting is bright and professional, with a slightly blurred background of other industrial machinery. The image conveys a sense of teamwork, technology, and data-driven problem-solving. There is no text on the image.

2025-07-29 11:31:29,614 - INFO - Generating image with prompt: A high-quality, photorealistic professional image for a blog post about "continuous improvement" in an industrial maintenance setting. A diverse team of three maintenance professionals—a white male manager in his 40s, a Black female technician in her 30s, and a younger Hispanic male technician—are gathered around a large, ruggedized tablet in a clean, modern factory. They are all wearing appropriate PPE, including safety glasses and company-branded work shirts. The manager is pointing to a graph on the tablet screen showing an upward trend for OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness). The female technician is holding a wrench and nodding in agreement, while the younger technician looks on intently. In the background, well-maintained industrial machinery with clean floors is visible but slightly out of focus. The lighting is bright and optimistic, conveying a sense of collaboration, data-driven decision-making, and success. The image should be text-free.

In the foreground, a diverse team of three maintenance professionals—a Caucasian male, a Black female, and an Asian male—are gathered around a large industrial pump and motor assembly. They are all wearing modern PPE: hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests over their work uniforms. The Black female is holding a ruggedized tablet displaying colorful graphs and data (like a vibration spectrum), pointing to a detail on the screen and discussing it with her colleagues. The pump is clean and appears well-maintained. In the background, other industrial machinery is visible but slightly out of focus, conveying a sense of a large, active operational environment. The lighting is bright and professional, with no harsh shadows. The image should feel collaborative, high-tech, and focused on proactive maintenance. There is no text or branding on the image.

A diverse maintenance team of two, a man of South Asian descent and a woman of Caucasian descent, are standing in front of a large, blue industrial electric motor. The woman is holding a ruggedized tablet displaying colorful vibration spectrum graphs (FFT) and trend lines, with no text visible. She is pointing at the screen, discussing the data with the man. The man is looking intently at the tablet and then at the motor, engaged in the conversation. Both are wearing appropriate PPE: white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility yellow vests over their navy blue work uniforms. The lighting is bright and professional, and the background showing other industrial equipment is slightly blurred to focus on the team and the motor. The overall mood is collaborative, high-tech, and proactive.

In the foreground, a female maintenance manager of South Asian descent with a determined expression is viewing a tablet. The tablet screen shows a dashboard with graphs and 3D models of industrial equipment with green, yellow, and red health indicators. In the background, slightly out of focus, is a clean, modern manufacturing facility with robotic arms and conveyor belts. A male colleague of African descent is in the background inspecting a large electric motor. Both individuals are wearing appropriate PPE, including safety glasses and high-visibility vests over their professional attire. The lighting is bright and clean, conveying a sense of technological advancement and operational excellence. The image should be shot from a slightly low angle to empower the subjects.

In the foreground, a diverse team of three maintenance professionals—a middle-aged white male manager in a collared shirt and safety glasses, a young Hispanic female engineer with a tablet, and an older Black male technician in full PPE (hard hat, safety glasses, high-visibility vest)—are gathered around a large, brightly lit digital dashboard on a wall. The dashboard displays clean graphs and charts with maintenance KPI data (like OEE, MTTR, PM Compliance) using green, yellow, and red indicators. The team is engaged in a discussion, pointing at the screen. In the background, well-maintained industrial machinery like robotic arms and conveyor systems are visible but slightly out of focus. The lighting is bright and professional, conveying a sense of technological advancement and operational excellence. No text on the screen or anywhere else.

In the background, slightly out of focus, a male colleague of African descent is looking at a tablet displaying graphs and machinery schematics. The setting is a bright, clean, and modern manufacturing plant floor. The image should be professional, with no text, and convey a sense of high-tech precision and expertise in industrial maintenance.

2025-07-29 15:02:36,616 - INFO - Generating image with prompt: A photorealistic, wide-angle shot inside a clean, modern manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a female maintenance manager of South Asian descent and a male technician of Black descent are looking at a tablet together. They are both wearing safety glasses, hard hats, and high-visibility vests. The tablet screen is glowing, but the content is not visible. In the background, a large, complex piece of industrial equipment (like a CNC machine or a robotic arm) is visible but slightly out of focus. On the machine, a small, modern wireless industrial sensor with a subtle blinking blue LED light is visible, clearly mounted. The lighting is bright and professional, conveying a sense of high-tech competence and safety.
