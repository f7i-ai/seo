The scene features a reliability engineer or maintenance technician in full PPE (white hard hat, safety glasses, white sanitary lab coat or uniform, high-vis vest) inspecting a stainless steel electric motor connected to a pump. The environment is clean but industrial, with shiny stainless steel piping and wet floors indicating a recent washdown. The focus is on the technician inspecting a small, cylindrical stainless steel sensor mounted on the motor. The lighting is bright and clinical (cool tones). No text or overlays. Show the technician from the side or 3/4 view, engaged in the work.

The scene features two facility engineers, one male and one female, wearing full PPE including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. They are standing near a large cooling tower fan, looking at a tablet held by the female engineer (only the back of the tablet is visible). The cooling tower has visible IoT sensors attached to the motor housing and water piping, with subtle LED indicators. The background shows a blurred city skyline and a clear sky, emphasizing the "air" and "cooling" aspect. The lighting is golden hour, highlighting the metallic textures of the industrial equipment. No text overlays.

The technician is using a handheld ultrasonic device (seen from the back/side, focusing on the hardware form factor) with a coiled cable connecting to heavy-duty industrial headphones over their ears. They are holding a grease gun but are paused, listening intently. The background shows the depth of the facility with the conveyor belt stretching into the distance, slightly out of focus to emphasize the technician and the bearing. The lighting is industrial but dramatic, highlighting the texture of the machinery and the PPE. No text or overlays in the image.

The focus is on a large, yellow or orange industrial vibrating screen (shaker) in operation. A reliability engineer, wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-visibility vest, is standing safely to the side of the machine. They are holding a tablet (back of device visible) and looking at the machine, appearing to compare data on the screen with the physical equipment. The background is slightly blurred but shows conveyor belts and steel structures. The lighting is industrial but dramatic, highlighting the motion of the screen and the dust-free, organized nature of a modern facility. No text overlays.

In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers and OT architects (wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests) are gathered around a large industrial machine. One engineer is pointing at a ruggedized edge computing unit mounted on the side of the machine, while others look on with interest. The background shows blurred automated assembly lines and digital overlays of data streams (subtle, not cartoonish) fading as they move away from the machine, symbolizing data processing at the edge. The lighting is cool industrial blue with warm accents on the people. No text in the image. 8k resolution.

In the background, blurred slightly to create depth, are automated conveyor belts and robotic arms in motion. Superimposed subtly in the air, representing "data gravity," are faint, glowing digital particles or streams of light flowing from the machines into a localized hub near the engineers, rather than flying off into the ceiling/cloud. The lighting is a mix of cool industrial blue and warm safety orange. 8k resolution, highly detailed textures on the machinery.

In the foreground, a diverse group of process engineers (wearing hard hats and safety glasses) are looking at a large bank of monitors. The monitors display complex data visualizations, heat maps of a reactor, and neural network topology diagrams, but no legible text. One engineer in the center is holding a tablet, back facing the camera. In the background, through a large safety glass window, the blurred industrial silhouette of a large stainless steel chemical reactor and piping is visible. The lighting is professional, with cool blue tones from the screens contrasting with the warm industrial lighting of the plant floor. High-tech, 2026 aesthetic.

2026-02-02 11:09:54,400 - INFO - Generating image with prompt: A photorealistic, cinematic wide shot inside a large industrial facility or remote mining site. In the foreground, a reliability engineer wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-visibility vest is inspecting a large industrial electric motor. The engineer is looking at the back of a rugged tablet held in their hand (screen not visible). Attached to the motor is a small, sleek, industrial wireless sensor (orange or industrial grey) with a small antenna. In the background, out of focus, are other industrial assets like conveyors or piping, suggesting a complex, distributed environment. The lighting is natural but highlights the sensor and the engineer's professional focus. No text in the image. 8k resolution.

The scene is cold, with visible frost and mist in the air. In the foreground, a reliability engineer wearing a heavy insulated freezer suit, high-visibility vest, hard hat, and safety glasses is inspecting a large industrial evaporator fan unit. They are holding a tablet (back of device visible) to check data, but looking at the machinery. In the background, rows of racked pallets wrapped in plastic are visible, covered in a light frost. The lighting is industrial cool-blue with dramatic shadows, highlighting the scale and harsh environment of the facility. No text or overlays.

2026-02-02 13:44:38,131 - INFO - Generating image with prompt: A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern food processing facility. The lighting is cool and industrial, with steam rising slightly from the machinery. In the foreground, focused sharply, is a sleek, stainless steel industrial gateway mounted directly onto the side of a conveyor belt frame. The device has M12 cables connected to it. The background shows a blurred production line with workers in full hygienic PPE (white coats, hairnets, safety glasses, gloves) inspecting the line. One worker is holding a tablet (back of tablet visible) likely checking data. The environment looks wet and clean, emphasizing the "washdown" nature. No text overlays. High contrast, professional industrial photography style.

The lighting is cool and clean, emphasizing a "future energy" aesthetic with subtle blue LED accents on machinery. In the foreground, a diverse team of two reliability engineers (one male, one female) wearing full PPE (white hard hats, safety glasses, high-visibility vests over blue coveralls) are inspecting a large, horizontal reciprocating compressor. The female engineer is pointing at a sensor mounted on the compressor's packing case (an eddy current probe location), while the male engineer holds a rugged industrial tablet (back of tablet facing camera) referencing data. The background shows complex piping, pressure vessels, and digital monitoring displays. No text in the image. High resolution, 8k.

In the foreground, a close-up (macro style) of a small, ruggedized industrial IoT sensor mounted securely on the side of a large blue electric motor. The sensor has a small status LED glowing softly green. In the slightly blurred background, a diverse group of maintenance engineers (men and women) wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests are consulting a tablet, looking at data visualizations. The lighting is professional and dramatic, highlighting the sensor as the focal point. No text or words in the image. 16:9 aspect ratio.
