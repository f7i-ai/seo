2026-02-04 13:13:45,851 - INFO - Generating image with prompt: A close-up, photorealistic shot inside a modern industrial facility. Focus on a reliability engineer's hand holding a high-end vibration analyzer stylus against the bearing housing of a large, blue electric motor. In the background, slightly out of focus, is a complex array of piping and industrial machinery. The lighting is dramatic, highlighting the texture of the metal and the digital waveform display on the analyzer screen (which shows a spectral graph, not text). The engineer is wearing a safety glove and a high-visibility sleeve. The image conveys precision, technology, and industrial grit. No text overlays.

2026-02-04 15:42:24,723 - INFO - Generating image with prompt: A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern industrial manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a focused reliability engineer (wearing safety glasses, hard hat, and high-vis vest) is holding a ruggedized tablet displaying complex data visualizations and a 3D "digital twin" wireframe of a large electric motor. In the background, slightly out of focus, is the actual large industrial motor and pump assembly with visible wireless sensors attached to the cooling fins. The lighting is dramatic but professional, highlighting the connection between the physical machine and the digital analysis. No text overlays. The atmosphere conveys precision, technology, and industrial scale.

The scene captures the intersection of heavy machinery and digital technology. In the foreground, a reliability engineer in a hard hat and high-visibility vest is holding a ruggedized tablet, looking at a complex holographic overlay or digital dashboard projecting from a large turbine or conveyor system. In the background, blurred technicians are performing maintenance on yellow robotic arms. The lighting is dramatic, mixing the cool blue of digital interfaces with the warm industrial amber of factory lighting. The atmosphere conveys precision, control, and advanced technology. No text in the image.
