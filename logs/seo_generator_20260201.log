In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance engineers and plant managers (wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests) are looking at a large tablet held by one of them (only the back of the tablet is visible). They are standing in front of a complex packaging conveyor line with stainless steel machinery, blurred motion of bottles moving on the line. Overlaying the machinery in a subtle, semi-transparent way are digital holographic nodes or wireframes indicating "digital twin" or sensor data points, symbolizing the "AI layer" invisible to the naked eye. The lighting is industrial but warm, with a focus on the people and the machinery. 8k resolution, highly detailed.

One engineer is pointing at a ruggedized edge server rack mounted directly next to the machine, while another holds a tablet (back of tablet visible only). In the background, blurred slightly to create depth, are automated conveyor belts and robotic arms. The lighting is a mix of cool industrial blue LED strips and warm ambient factory lighting. No text or holograms. The atmosphere conveys serious, professional industrial operations.

The interface displays complex data visualizations: a 3D "Digital Twin" of a motor, a fluctuating graph line turning from red to green, and a clear text box (simulated, no readable text) indicating a "Prescription" or path forward. The background is a blur of automated machinery, conveyor belts, and robotic arms, lit with cool industrial blues and warm amber safety lights. The atmosphere is professional, focused, and futuristic, emphasizing the collaboration between human expertise and artificial intelligence. 8k resolution, highly detailed textures on the PPE and machinery.

2026-02-01 18:51:40,913 - INFO - Generating image with prompt: A photorealistic, cinematic wide shot inside a large industrial food manufacturing facility. The focus is on a massive stainless steel spiral freezer system. In the foreground, a reliability engineer (wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, ear protection, and a heavy insulated freezer jacket) is inspecting the drive motor of the spiral freezer. They are holding a vibration analysis tool (back of device visible) against the motor housing. The background shows the spiral conveyor belt laden with frozen food products (like pastries or patties) moving upwards. The lighting is cool and industrial, with a hint of "cold" blue mist or breath vapor to indicate the low temperature. The environment is clean, metallic, and high-tech. No text or overlays.

The scene shows a stainless steel industrial environment with large tanks and piping. In the foreground, slightly to the side, is a robust, stainless steel IoT gateway enclosure mounted on a wall using sanitary standoffs. The enclosure has a sloped top and M12 cable connectors. A maintenance technician, wearing a white food-safety coat, hairnet, safety glasses, and blue nitrile gloves, is inspecting the device, holding a rugged tablet (screen not visible). In the background, another worker in full PPE is performing a washdown of a tank using a hose, with visible steam or mist, illustrating the harsh, wet environment. The lighting is bright, cool, and clinical, typical of food production areas. No text or logos on the equipment.

In the foreground, a reliability engineer wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, and high-visibility vest is inspecting a large, heavy-duty industrial coal crusher (machinery painted industrial yellow or blue). The engineer is holding a tablet (back of device visible only) and looking at a wireless vibration sensor magnetically attached to the bearing housing. The background shows conveyor belts, steel structures, and subtle atmospheric dust motes caught in shafts of light, emphasizing the harsh environment. The lighting is dramatic but professional, highlighting the technology and the scale of the machinery. No text or overlays.

The scene focuses on a stainless steel conveyor line or processing machine (like a feather picker or evisceration line). In the foreground, a close-up of a shiny, 316L stainless steel accelerometer mounted on a motor housing. The sensor looks robust, with a heavy-duty cable routed neatly. In the background, slightly out of focus, a maintenance technician wearing a white food-safety coat, hard hat, safety glasses, and hearing protection is inspecting a tablet (back of tablet visible). The lighting is bright, cool industrial LED lighting, reflecting off the wet, clean stainless steel surfaces, emphasizing the "washdown ready" environment. No text in the image.

2026-02-01 19:26:48,576 - INFO - Generating image with prompt: A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern industrial mineral processing plant or quarry. The focus is on a large, yellow industrial vibrating screen (mining equipment) in operation. A reliability engineer, wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, and high-visibility vest, is standing safely on a walkway next to the machine. They are holding a ruggedized tablet (back of tablet visible) and looking from the tablet to a wireless sensor mounted on the side plate of the vibrating screen. The lighting is dramatic but professional, highlighting the dust in the air and the motion of the machine. No text overlays. The image conveys technology meeting heavy industry.

The scene focuses on a stainless steel conveyor belt carrying baked goods (like biscuits or crackers). In the foreground, a sleek, cylindrical stainless steel sensor (IP69K style) is mounted on a hygienic bracket above the belt, emitting a faint, invisible beam (implied focus). In the background, a reliability engineer wearing a white lab coat, hair net, safety glasses, and high-visibility vest is inspecting a tablet (back of device visible only). The environment is gleaming, wet (suggesting recent washdown), and industrial. Lighting is bright, cool, and clinical. No text overlays.

2026-02-01 21:42:41,136 - INFO - Generating image with prompt: A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern wastewater treatment facility. In the foreground, a reliability engineer wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-visibility vest is inspecting a surface aeration tank. The engineer is holding a tablet (screen not visible) and looking at a heavy-duty conduit running down into the churning, dark water. The water is turbulent with white foam, indicating active aeration. In the background, large industrial piping and walkways are visible under overcast natural lighting. The image conveys industrial precision and the rugged nature of wastewater maintenance. No text or overlays.
