In the foreground, a diverse pair of maintenance professionals (one male, one female) are collaborating. They are wearing clean, professional PPE including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One professional is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet (showing only the back of the device), while the other is pointing toward a large, well-maintained industrial motor assembly. The background shows a clean, organized "brownfield" factory setting with a mix of legacy machinery and modern sensor wiring. The lighting is bright and professional, emphasizing a culture of safety and high-tech reliability. No text or logos are visible on the equipment or clothing. Full-body or waist-up view.

In the foreground, a diverse team of three maintenance professionals—two men and one woman—are standing near a large industrial motor and pump assembly. They are wearing clean, appropriate PPE including white hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One technician is pointing toward a specific part of the machinery while the others look on, engaged in a collaborative discussion. One technician is holding a rugged industrial tablet, but only the back of the device is visible to the camera. The lighting is bright and natural for an industrial setting, highlighting the metallic textures of the equipment and the professional demeanor of the staff. No text or logos are visible on the equipment or clothing. Full body shots of the professionals are shown.

In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (one female, two male) are standing near a large, well-maintained industrial motor. They are wearing full PPE: white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility yellow vests. One technician is holding a tablet, but only the back of the device is visible to the camera. The background shows a series of conveyors and stainless steel piping, all brightly lit with natural and overhead LED lighting. The atmosphere is professional, organized, and safe. No text or logos are visible on the equipment or clothing. Full-body shots of the people, showing them engaged in a technical discussion.

In the foreground, a diverse team of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are collaborating. They are wearing full PPE, including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility orange vests over professional work clothes. One technician is pointing toward a large, complex industrial pump system, while another holds a ruggedized tablet (shown from the back, no screen visible). The lighting is bright and professional, highlighting the metallic textures of the machinery. The background shows a well-organized production line with subtle motion blur to indicate activity. No text or digital overlays are present in the image. Full-body view of the professionals.

The background shows a clean, brightly lit warehouse environment with organized shelving units and a glimpse of a manufacturing floor through a distant doorway. The focus is on the professional interaction and the organized state of the facility. No text or screens are visible. Full-body view of the professionals.

One person is holding a rugged industrial tablet, showing only the back of the device to the camera. They are looking at a large, wall-mounted digital display in the background that shows complex data visualizations and charts (no legible text). The lighting is bright and industrial, highlighting the clean, organized state of the factory. The focus is sharp on the people and the machinery, conveying a sense of advanced technology and teamwork. Full-body shot, photorealistic style.

2026-02-20 15:30:43,526 - INFO - Generating image with prompt: A high-angle, wide-shot photograph of a clean, modern mid-sized manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of three professionals—a female plant manager in a white hard hat and high-visibility vest, and two male technicians in blue coveralls and safety glasses—are standing near a large, complex industrial motor and pump assembly. They are looking at the machine, appearing to discuss its condition. One technician is holding a ruggedized tablet, but only the back of the device is visible to the camera. The background shows a well-lit production line with conveyors and robotic arms. The lighting is bright and professional, emphasizing a high-tech but "real-world" industrial atmosphere. All personnel are wearing full appropriate PPE, including hard hats, safety glasses, and steel-toed boots. No screens or text are visible.

They are wearing full PPE, including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility neon vests. One professional is holding an industrial tablet, showing only the rugged black back of the device to the camera. They are pointing toward a specific component of the pump, engaged in a collaborative technical discussion. The background shows a well-lit facility with various pipes, stainless steel machinery, and a distant overhead conveyor system, all in sharp focus. No text or digital overlays are visible.

In the foreground, a diverse team of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are standing near a large, well-maintained centrifugal pump and motor assembly. They are wearing clean, professional PPE: white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility yellow vests over work shirts. One technician is pointing toward the motor housing while another holds a rugged industrial tablet (showing only the black back of the device). The background shows a clean, organized "brownfield" factory environment with overhead conveyors and piping, softly blurred to keep focus on the team. The lighting is bright and natural, conveying a sense of efficiency and high-tech reliability. No text or digital displays are visible. Full body shots of the professionals.

One professional is holding an industrial tablet (viewed from the back, showing a rugged black case), while the other points toward a piece of orange Kubota industrial equipment in the mid-ground. The equipment has a clear, visible QR code asset tag on its side. The background shows a clean, well-lit "brownfield" factory setting with various pipes and machinery. The lighting is bright and natural, emphasizing a high-tech, efficient industrial atmosphere. No text or logos are visible on the tablet screen or in the air. Full body shots of the workers.

One person is pointing toward a neatly organized rack of MRO spare parts (motors, gears, and sealed components), while another holds a ruggedized tablet (back of the device visible to the camera). The background shows a clean, well-lit manufacturing floor with a mix of legacy and modern machinery. The lighting is bright and industrial, emphasizing a high-tech yet practical "brownfield" environment. No text or logos are visible on any surfaces. Full-body view of the workers.

In the foreground, a diverse group of three professionals—a maintenance manager, a quality engineer, and a plant director—are standing near a large, well-maintained industrial compressor. They are all wearing appropriate PPE, including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility yellow vests. One person is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet, but only the back of the device is visible to the camera. The background shows a clean, organized "brownfield" factory setting with a mix of legacy and modern machinery, overhead conveyors, and clear safety floor markings. The lighting is bright and professional, conveying a sense of efficiency, reliability, and technological advancement. Full-body shots of the people, no text or words visible in the image.

In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (two men, one woman) are collaborating. They are wearing clean, professional PPE: white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility orange vests over work shirts. One technician is pointing toward a large, well-maintained industrial traction motor and drive sheave system in the mid-ground. Another technician is holding a ruggedized tablet, showing only the back of the device. The environment is a "brownfield" plant that has been modernized—clean floors, organized cable runs, and clear safety markings. The lighting is bright and professional, emphasizing a sense of high-tech reliability and safety. No text or logos are visible on the equipment or clothing. Full-body shots of the professionals.

In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are standing together in a collaborative huddle. They are wearing clean, professional PPE: white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility orange vests over navy blue work shirts. One professional is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet, but only the back of the device is visible to the camera. They are looking toward a large, complex piece of machinery (a robotic assembly arm or a large industrial pump) in the mid-ground. The lighting is bright and natural, coming from high warehouse windows. The background shows a well-organized plant with clear floor markings and other machinery, slightly out of focus to emphasize the professionals. No text, logos, or screens are visible. Full-body shots of the professionals.

They are wearing appropriate PPE, including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. The maintenance manager is gesturing toward a large, well-maintained industrial pump system. One person is holding an industrial tablet (shown from the back, no screen visible). The lighting is bright and professional, highlighting the clean but used nature of the machinery. Full-body shot, showing the scale of the industrial environment. No text or words in the image.

They are wearing clean, professional PPE including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility yellow vests over work shirts. One technician is pointing toward a specific section of the pump, while another holds a ruggedized industrial tablet (shown from the back, no screen visible). The background shows a clean, well-lit factory environment with various pipes, motors, and a conveyor system in the distance. The lighting is bright and natural, conveying a sense of organized, high-tech industrial efficiency. No text or logos are visible.

In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are standing together near a large industrial pump and conveyor system. They are wearing clean, professional PPE: white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility orange vests over work shirts. One person is holding a ruggedized tablet, but only the back of the device is visible to the camera. They are looking at the machinery and discussing a project, appearing focused and collaborative. The background shows a well-lit, organized factory floor with various pipes, motors, and electrical panels, suggesting a "brownfield" environment that has been modernized. No text or screens are visible. Full-body shot showing the industrial environment and the scale of the equipment.

In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are standing near a large, well-maintained industrial motor and pump assembly. They are wearing clean, professional PPE: white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility yellow vests over work shirts. One technician is pointing toward a specific part of the machinery, while another holds a ruggedized industrial tablet (shown from the back, no screen visible). The background shows a clean, organized factory environment with overhead conveyors and automated lines, softly blurred to maintain focus on the team. The lighting is bright and natural, conveying a sense of high-tech efficiency and safety. No text or logos are visible. Full body shots of the professionals.

In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are standing near a large, complex piece of machinery (a high-speed bottling line or a large industrial motor). They are wearing full professional PPE: white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility yellow vests over work shirts. One technician is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet, but only the back of the device is visible to the camera. They are pointing toward a specific section of the machine, engaged in a collaborative discussion. The lighting is bright and professional, highlighting the metallic textures of the equipment and the clean, organized environment of a top-tier manufacturing plant. No text or logos are visible. Full-body view of the professionals.

In the foreground, a diverse team of two maintenance professionals (one male, one female) are standing on a clean mezzanine walkway overlooking a production line of conveyors and pumps. They are wearing professional PPE, including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility yellow vests over work shirts. One professional is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet (viewed from the back, showing a durable black casing, no screen visible), while the other is pointing toward a specific motor on the floor below. The background shows a well-lit, organized factory floor with various machines and pipes. The lighting is bright and natural, emphasizing a "future-ready" and safe working environment. Full-body shots, professional atmosphere, no text or digital overlays in the image.

In the foreground, a diverse group of three professionals—a female maintenance manager in a white hard hat and high-visibility vest, and two male technicians in blue uniforms and safety glasses—are standing near a large, well-maintained industrial compressor. They are engaged in a professional discussion. One technician is holding an industrial tablet, but we only see the rugged back of the device, not the screen. The lighting is bright and professional, highlighting the polished concrete floors and the organized layout of the plant. No text or logos are visible on the equipment. The focus is on the collaboration and the high-tech environment. Full-body shots of the people, showing appropriate PPE including steel-toed boots.

One person is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet (viewed from the back, showing a protective black casing, no screen visible), while the other points toward a large, clean industrial motor assembly on a production line. The background shows a well-lit, organized factory floor with conveyors and robotic arms, slightly blurred to maintain focus on the technicians. The lighting is bright and professional, conveying a sense of advanced technology and safety. Full body shots of the individuals are visible, showing sturdy work boots. No text or logos are present in the image.

In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are standing near a large, complex industrial pump and motor assembly. They are wearing clean, professional PPE: white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility orange vests over navy work shirts. One technician is pointing toward a specific part of the machinery while the others look on, engaged in a collaborative technical discussion. One technician has a ruggedized tablet held in their hand, but only the back of the device is visible to the camera. The background shows a clean, well-lit "brownfield" factory floor with pipes, overhead conveyors, and other machinery slightly out of focus. The lighting is bright and professional, emphasizing a culture of safety and advanced technology. No text or screens are visible. Full-body shots of the professionals.

In the foreground, a diverse team of three maintenance professionals (two men, one woman) are collaborating near a large, complex piece of machinery that is undergoing a systematic overhaul. They are wearing professional PPE, including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility yellow vests. One technician is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet (shown from the back, no screen visible), while another points toward a specific section of the machine's internal gears. The environment is clean, well-lit, and represents a "brownfield" facility with a mix of heavy steel machinery and modern digital integration points. Full-body shots of the workers are visible, emphasizing a professional and safe working environment. No text or logos should be visible in the image.

They are wearing clean, professional PPE, including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility vests over work shirts. One technician is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet, showing only the back of the device to the camera. They are engaged in a professional discussion, looking at the machine with a sense of focused expertise. The background shows a clean, well-lit factory environment with conveyors and robotic arms, slightly blurred to maintain focus on the people. No text or logos are visible. Full-body shots of the professionals.

In the foreground, a diverse pair of maintenance professionals (one man, one woman) are collaborating. They are wearing clean, professional PPE, including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility yellow vests. One professional is holding a rugged industrial tablet, showing only the back of the device to the camera. They are standing next to a large, well-maintained industrial motor that has a prominent 2D Data Matrix (UID) metal tag riveted to its side. The background shows a clean, organized "brownfield" factory floor with various pipes and machinery, softly blurred to keep focus on the professionals and the asset. The lighting is bright and natural, conveying a sense of efficiency and advanced technology. No text or words are visible in the image. Full-body or three-quarter view.

In the foreground, a diverse team of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are standing near a large, complex piece of machinery. They are all wearing full PPE, including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility orange vests over work shirts. One technician is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet, but only the back of the device is visible to the camera. They are pointing toward a specific section of the machine, appearing to discuss a strategy. The lighting is bright and professional, highlighting the metallic textures of the equipment and the clean, polished concrete floor. No text or digital screens are visible. Full-body view of the professionals.
