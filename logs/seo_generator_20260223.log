One technician is using a handheld thermal imaging camera (shown from the back, display not visible), while the other is taking notes on a ruggedized tablet. The motor is clean but shows signs of industrial use, with conduit and cooling fins clearly visible. The background shows a clean, well-lit production line with robotic arms and conveyors. The lighting is bright and industrial, emphasizing a high-tech, reliable environment. No text or words appear in the image. Full body shots of the professionals.

A maintenance technician in high-visibility PPE and a hard hat is looking skeptically at a rugged tablet showing a complex data dashboard. In the background, a large industrial motor is being serviced. The lighting is natural industrial overhead, and the focus is on the technician's expression of doubt as they compare the screen's data to the physical machine in front of them. No text on the screen, diverse workforce, high detail on the mechanical components.

2026-02-23 14:37:31,069 - INFO - Generating image with prompt: A high-tech industrial maintenance office where a frustrated reliability engineer is looking at a computer screen filled with messy, red-highlighted spreadsheets and "Error" messages. In the background, through a glass window, a large industrial motor is being dismantled by technicians. The lighting is a mix of cool blue screen light and warm industrial overheads. The scene conveys the disconnect between poor digital data and the physical reality of machine failure. Photo-realistic, 8k, cinematic.

In the foreground, a diverse team of three maintenance professionals (two men, one woman) are conducting a collaborative inspection. They are wearing full professional PPE: white hard hats, clear safety glasses, high-visibility vests over blue work uniforms, and steel-toed boots. One technician is kneeling to examine a conveyor motor assembly, while the other two stand nearby, one holding a ruggedized industrial tablet (showing only the back of the device). The background shows a gleaming stainless steel rotary filler and a series of conveyors with green glass bottles moving through the system. The lighting is bright and clinical, emphasizing a high-tech, "Industry 4.0" atmosphere. No text or digital displays are visible. Full-body shots of the professionals.

In the foreground, a diverse team of three professionals—a male maintenance manager in a white hard hat and high-visibility vest, a female reliability engineer in a blue hard hat and safety glasses, and a technician in a grey work uniform—are standing near a large, complex piece of machinery (a multi-stage conveyor system with motors and gearboxes). The maintenance manager is gesturing toward a specific section of the machine while the engineer holds a rugged industrial tablet (shown from the back, display not visible). The environment is clean, well-lit, and organized, reflecting a high-standard reliability culture. All individuals are wearing appropriate PPE, including steel-toed boots and ear protection. The background shows the blurred activity of a productive factory floor. No text or logos are visible.

2026-02-23 15:24:34,779 - INFO - Generating image with prompt: A professional, photo-realistic wide shot of a modern industrial manufacturing floor in 2026. In the foreground, a diverse team of two reliability engineers (one male, one female) wearing clean, high-visibility vests, hard hats, and safety glasses are inspecting a large, complex industrial motor-pump assembly. One engineer is pointing at a small, wireless IIoT sensor mounted on the bearing housing, while the other holds a ruggedized industrial tablet (showing only the back of the device). The background shows a clean, well-lit facility with automated conveyor systems and other high-tech machinery. The lighting is bright and professional, emphasizing a high-tech, efficient industrial environment. No text or digital overlays. Full body shots of the engineers.
