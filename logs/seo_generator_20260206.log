In the foreground, a reliability engineer (wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-visibility vest) is examining a large industrial motor or conveyor system. They are holding a tablet (back of the device visible) as if comparing data on the screen to the physical asset. In the background, blurred slightly, are other technicians working and automated machinery in motion. The lighting is industrial but dramatic, with cool blue and warm amber tones highlighting the metallic textures of the equipment. No text or overlays. The atmosphere conveys precision, technology, and forensic analysis.

In the foreground, a diverse group of three professionals (a Reliability Engineer in a white hard hat, a Plant Manager in a blue hard hat, and a CFO-type in business casual with safety glasses) are looking at a rugged tablet held by the engineer. The tablet screen is not visible to the viewer (we see the back of the device). They are engaged in a serious but collaborative discussion, pointing toward a large, complex industrial machine in the background that has subtle IoT sensors attached to it. The lighting is professional and industrial—cool blues and bright safety yellows. The depth of field focuses on the people, with the factory floor slightly blurred in the background. High resolution, 8k style.

In the foreground, a diverse group of professionals (a maintenance manager in a safety vest and hard hat, and two executives in business casual attire) are looking at a large, transparent glass digital display board. The display shows futuristic but readable data visualizations: a waterfall chart showing cost savings, a heat map of asset health (red/yellow/green dots), and a trend line going upward. The maintenance manager is pointing at the "savings" section of the chart, explaining it to the executives who look engaged and impressed. The background shows the blurred depth of a clean, high-tech factory floor with automated machinery. Lighting is professional, emphasizing the glow of the data and the collaborative atmosphere. No text should be legible on the screen, just the shapes of the charts.

In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance technicians (men and women, mixed ages) are gathered around a large industrial motor. They are wearing standard PPE: hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One older technician is pointing at a specific component of the motor, while a younger technician holds a ruggedized tablet (showing only the back of the device) and appears to be listening intently. The lighting is industrial but warm, highlighting the collaboration. In the background, blurred conveyor belts and machinery suggest a busy production environment. No text or overlays. The mood is professional, collaborative, and focused on mentorship.

2026-02-06 16:12:12,174 - INFO - Generating image with prompt: A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a clean, modern industrial facility. In the foreground, a diverse maintenance team is preparing for a confined space entry near a large stainless steel tank. One technician (wearing a harness, hard hat, and safety glasses) is checking a handheld gas monitor (screen not visible). Another team member (the attendant) is holding a clipboard or tablet and standing near a tripod winch system set up over the manhole. The lighting is industrial but warm, highlighting the safety gear and the seriousness of the procedure. No text or words in the image. Background shows blurred industrial piping and machinery.

2026-02-06 16:14:23,019 - INFO - Generating image with prompt: A photo-realistic, cinematic shot inside a modern chemical processing plant. In the foreground, a diverse maintenance technician (wearing a hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-visibility vest with a chemical safety badge clearly visible) is looking at a ruggedized tablet held in their hand (showing the back of the device, not the screen). In the background, there is a complex network of stainless steel piping, yellow valves, and large processing tanks. The lighting is industrial but dramatic, highlighting the cleanliness and high-tech nature of the facility. Another worker in the background is wearing a full protective suit (Level B or C) inspecting a gauge, adding context to the chemical handling theme. No text overlays.
