Two maintenance professionals, a man and a woman of diverse backgrounds, are inspecting a large, blue industrial induction motor. They are wearing full professional PPE: white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility orange vests over navy blue work uniforms. One professional is using a handheld thermal imaging camera (showing only the back of the device) to scan the motor's housing, while the other is looking at a tablet (showing only the back). The environment is clean, well-lit, and features polished concrete floors and organized conduit piping in the background. No text or logos are visible. Full body shots of the professionals.

2026-02-18 14:14:51,433 - INFO - Generating image with prompt: A professional, photo-realistic scene in a modern industrial control room. A diverse group of three maintenance managers and engineers—two men and one woman of different ethnicities—are gathered around a large, sleek industrial workstation. They are wearing clean, professional work uniforms with high-visibility vests, hard hats, and safety glasses. One engineer is pointing toward a large, wall-mounted digital display that shows a complex, glowing logic tree diagram (no legible text). Another engineer is holding a rugged industrial tablet, showing only the back of the device. The environment is brightly lit with a mix of natural light and cool industrial LEDs, showing glimpses of a clean, high-tech manufacturing floor through a large glass window in the background. The focus is on their collaborative problem-solving and the professional atmosphere of a high-stakes reliability center.

They are conducting an audit of a complex industrial pump system. The manager, a woman in her 40s, is wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-visibility vest over a professional work shirt. She is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet, but we only see the back of the device. The technician, a man in his 50s, is wearing a blue hard hat and similar safety gear, pointing toward a specific component on the pump. The environment is clean, with clear safety markings on the floor and other high-tech machinery in the blurred background. The lighting is natural and crisp, emphasizing a high-tech, professional atmosphere. Full-body shot showing their stance and the scale of the equipment. No text or digital displays are visible.

2026-02-18 15:40:34,784 - INFO - Generating image with prompt: A professional photo-realistic scene in a modern, well-lit industrial warehouse. A diverse team of two maintenance professionals—one man and one woman—are performing an inventory audit. They are wearing full PPE, including white hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility neon vests over work shirts. One person is standing on a safety ladder checking a high shelf of organized mechanical components (large bearings and gearboxes), while the other stands below holding a ruggedized industrial tablet. We only see the back of the tablet, which is encased in a black protective shell. The warehouse background shows high-density racking with neatly labeled bins and a clean polished concrete floor. The focus is on the collaborative, methodical process of the count. No text or digital displays are visible. Full body shots showing professional work boots.
