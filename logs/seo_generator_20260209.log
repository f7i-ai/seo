2026-02-09 11:02:42,509 - INFO - Generating image with prompt: A photo-realistic, high-resolution hero image set inside a modern industrial manufacturing facility in Western Australia. The scene features a diverse team of three maintenance professionals. One worker is wearing a full-body safety harness and a hard hat with a headlamp, preparing to enter a large stainless steel industrial tank (confined space). A second worker, the 'stand-by person', is standing just outside the tank entrance, wearing a high-visibility vest, safety glasses, and holding a ruggedized tablet (back of device visible) to monitor digital permit status. A third person, a supervisor, is pointing at a lockout/tagout (LOTO) station nearby. The lighting is a mix of cool industrial LED and warm accent lighting from the machinery. No text or words should be visible in the image. The atmosphere conveys safety, professionalism, and advanced technology.

2026-02-09 11:39:23,956 - INFO - Generating image with prompt: A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern Australian manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of three professionals: a Maintenance Manager (male, 40s), a Safety Officer (female, 30s), and a Contractor (male, 20s). They are wearing standard Australian PPE: high-visibility vests with reflective strips, hard hats, and safety glasses. The Contractor is holding a rugged tablet (back facing camera) showing a green "Compliance Verified" checkmark interface. They are standing in front of a large industrial conveyor system. The background is clean but clearly an active "brownfield" factory with yellow safety walkways and industrial machinery. Lighting is professional and bright, highlighting the safety culture. No text or words should be visible in the environment.

The scene features a diverse maintenance team (men and women) wearing standard high-visibility vests (orange/yellow) and hard hats. In the foreground, a maintenance manager is looking at a large industrial machine (perhaps a conveyor or pump system) while holding a tablet device. The tablet screen is not visible (showing the back of the device). In the background, another technician is inspecting a sensor on a pipe. The lighting is professional and industrial, with a mix of natural light from skylights and cool LED factory lighting. No text or words should be visible in the image. The atmosphere conveys efficiency, safety, and modern technology integration.
