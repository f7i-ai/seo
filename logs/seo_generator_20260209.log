2026-02-09 11:02:42,509 - INFO - Generating image with prompt: A photo-realistic, high-resolution hero image set inside a modern industrial manufacturing facility in Western Australia. The scene features a diverse team of three maintenance professionals. One worker is wearing a full-body safety harness and a hard hat with a headlamp, preparing to enter a large stainless steel industrial tank (confined space). A second worker, the 'stand-by person', is standing just outside the tank entrance, wearing a high-visibility vest, safety glasses, and holding a ruggedized tablet (back of device visible) to monitor digital permit status. A third person, a supervisor, is pointing at a lockout/tagout (LOTO) station nearby. The lighting is a mix of cool industrial LED and warm accent lighting from the machinery. No text or words should be visible in the image. The atmosphere conveys safety, professionalism, and advanced technology.

2026-02-09 11:39:23,956 - INFO - Generating image with prompt: A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern Australian manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse group of three professionals: a Maintenance Manager (male, 40s), a Safety Officer (female, 30s), and a Contractor (male, 20s). They are wearing standard Australian PPE: high-visibility vests with reflective strips, hard hats, and safety glasses. The Contractor is holding a rugged tablet (back facing camera) showing a green "Compliance Verified" checkmark interface. They are standing in front of a large industrial conveyor system. The background is clean but clearly an active "brownfield" factory with yellow safety walkways and industrial machinery. Lighting is professional and bright, highlighting the safety culture. No text or words should be visible in the environment.

2026-02-09 12:14:18,553 - INFO - Generating image with prompt: A photorealistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern Australian manufacturing facility. The scene features a diverse group of maintenance engineers and plant managers (men and women) wearing standard high-visibility vests, hard hats, and safety glasses. They are standing near a large industrial conveyor belt system with a large electric motor. One engineer is pointing at a specific component on the motor where a small wireless sensor is attached. Another engineer is holding a tablet (showing only the back of the device, no screen visible) as if checking data. The lighting is professional and industrial, with a mix of cool factory lighting and warm highlights. The atmosphere is collaborative and focused on technology. No text or words should appear in the image. Background includes blurred industrial machinery to emphasize depth.

2026-02-09 13:12:25,968 - INFO - Generating image with prompt: A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern Australian manufacturing facility. The scene features a diverse group of maintenance engineers and operations managers (men and women) wearing standard Australian safety gear: high-visibility yellow and orange vests with reflective strips, hard hats, and safety glasses. They are standing near a large industrial conveyor belt system and a series of heavy industrial pumps. One engineer is inspecting a small, wireless sensor attached to a motor, while another holds a tablet (back of the device visible only) gesturing toward the machinery. The lighting is professional and industrial, highlighting the "brownfield" nature of the equipment—clean but clearly used, not futuristic sci-fi. No text or holograms in the image. The atmosphere conveys efficiency, safety, and modern technology integration.

2026-02-09 13:57:12,787 - INFO - Generating image with prompt: A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern Australian manufacturing facility. The scene features a diverse group of maintenance engineers and plant managers (men and women) wearing standard high-visibility vests, hard hats, and safety glasses. They are standing near a large industrial conveyor belt system and a series of heavy motors. One engineer is holding a tablet (back of device visible only) pointing toward a machine, implying data scanning. The lighting is professional and industrial, with a mix of cool blue ambient light and warm task lighting. The facility looks "brownfield" but clean—a mix of older heavy machinery fitted with modern, small wireless sensors. No text or words should be visible in the image.

2026-02-09 14:07:07,699 - INFO - Generating image with prompt: A photo-realistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern Australian manufacturing facility. The lighting is a mix of natural light from high windows and cool industrial LED lighting. In the foreground, a diverse group of three professionals (a female plant manager in a white hard hat and high-vis vest, a male maintenance technician in blue overalls and safety glasses, and a reliability engineer) are standing near a large conveyor system. They are looking at a tablet held by the manager (only the back of the tablet is visible). The background shows active machinery, yellow safety walkways, and blurred motion of production. The atmosphere is clean, high-tech, and efficient. No text or words should be visible in the image. The focus is on collaboration and technology in an industrial setting.
