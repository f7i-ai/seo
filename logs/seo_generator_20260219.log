In the foreground, a diverse team of three professionals—a woman in a white hard hat and high-visibility vest, and two men in blue industrial workwear and safety glasses—are standing near a large, clean, high-tech robotic assembly line. They are engaged in a professional discussion. One person is holding a rugged industrial tablet, but only the back of the device is visible. The factory is brightly lit with natural light from high windows, showing a clean, organized environment with subtle digital sensor nodes attached to the machinery. The atmosphere is one of high-efficiency and advanced technology. No text or logos are visible. Full-body shots of the workers in appropriate PPE.

A diverse team of two maintenance professionals—one man and one woman—are working together. They are wearing clean, branded navy blue technician uniforms, hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. The woman is standing, holding a professional-grade calibration standard device (showing only the back of the device), while the man is kneeling slightly to inspect a complex industrial pressure transmitter mounted on a stainless steel pipe manifold. The background is a clean, well-lit facility with blurred-out high-tech machinery and organized tool stations. The lighting is bright and clinical, emphasizing a high-tech, precision-oriented environment. Full body shots, focused on the collaborative work and the sophisticated industrial setting. No text or screens are visible.

2026-02-19 12:52:30,646 - INFO - Generating image with prompt: A wide-angle, photo-realistic shot of a modern, clean industrial manufacturing floor in 2026. In the foreground, a diverse team of three maintenance professionals (two men, one woman) are standing near a large, complex robotic assembly arm. They are all wearing full professional PPE: white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility orange vests over navy blue work uniforms. One technician is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet, but only the back of the device is visible to the camera. They are pointing toward a specific section of the machinery, engaged in a collaborative discussion. The lighting is bright and professional, highlighting the polished concrete floor and the intricate wiring and sensors attached to the machinery. No text or logos are visible. The focus is on the professional interaction and the high-tech environment.
