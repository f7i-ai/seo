In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance technicians (one female, two male) are gathered around a large industrial pump. They are wearing full PPE including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. The female technician is holding a ruggedized tablet, showing the back of the device to the camera (screen hidden), while pointing at a specific component on the pump. The other two are looking attentively at the area she is indicating. The background shows a busy but organized factory floor with yellow safety walkways and blurred machinery. The lighting is bright and industrial, highlighting the professionalism and safety focus of the team. No text or overlays.
