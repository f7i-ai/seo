    🎨 Generating image with prompt: A wide-angle, cinematic shot of a modern, clean factory floor. In the foreground, a maintenance manager in a hard hat and high-vis vest stands looking at a transparent, holographic dashboard floating in front of them. The dashboard displays clear charts and graphs for "OEE," "MTBF," and "MTTR," with positive upward and downward trends highlighted in green. In the background, well-maintained industrial machinery with subtle blue glowing sensor lights is visible. The image should convey a sense of control, data-driven strategy, and futuristic operational excellence.

    🎨 Generating image with prompt: A split-screen hero image. On the left, a reliability engineer in a hard hat is looking at a tablet displaying a colorful vibration analysis graph, with a large industrial pump visible in the background. On the right, a close-up of a financial ledger or spreadsheet showing depreciation schedules. A subtle, transparent "versus" symbol is overlaid in the middle, emphasizing the conflict between operational data and accounting data. The overall tone should be professional and industrial.

    🎨 Generating image with prompt: A split-screen image for a blog post on corrective maintenance. The left side depicts a chaotic, dark factory floor with sparks flying from a broken machine, a frustrated technician on a radio, and red warning lights flashing. The right side shows a bright, clean, modern factory floor where a calm technician uses a tablet to view a 3D model of the same machine, with green status indicators in the background. The overall tone should contrast chaos with control and strategy.

    🎨 Generating image with prompt: A professional, clean infographic-style image for a blog post. The central visual is a large toolbox labeled "Hybrid Maintenance Framework". Five distinct, modern-looking tools are emerging from the toolbox, each with a clear label: "Reactive (RTF)", "Preventive (PM)", "Condition-Based (CBM)", "Predictive (PdM)", and "Prescriptive". To the right of the toolbox, show a simplified 3x3 criticality matrix with the X-axis labeled "Consequence of Failure" and the Y-axis labeled "Likelihood of Failure". Arrows should be pointing from the different tools towards different sections of the matrix, visually connecting the right tool to the right risk level (e.g., the Predictive tool points to the high-consequence/high-likelihood corner). The background should be a clean, slightly out-of-focus image of a modern, well-lit industrial facility. The overall color scheme should be professional, using blues, grays, and a single accent color like orange or green.
