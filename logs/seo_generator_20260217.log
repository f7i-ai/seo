In the foreground, a reliability engineer wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-visibility vest is inspecting a large industrial motor. The engineer is holding a tablet device (viewed from the back, screen not visible) appearing to check data. In the background, blurred but visible, are other diverse technicians working on machinery. The lighting is industrial but bright, highlighting the clean, organized nature of a modern "smart factory." No text or overlays in the image. Focus on the interaction between the human worker and the industrial asset.

2026-02-17 10:32:02,115 - INFO - Generating image with prompt: A photo-realistic, high-resolution hero image set inside a modern but active "brownfield" manufacturing facility. The scene features a diverse group of three professionals: a facility manager (female, mid-40s, wearing a white hard hat and safety vest), a maintenance technician (male, 30s, blue coveralls, safety glasses), and a plant director (male, 50s, business casual with safety gear). They are standing near a large industrial conveyor system with visible motors and pumps. The facility manager is holding a rugged tablet (back of device visible only) and pointing toward a specific component on the machinery, indicating a discussion about performance or metrics. The lighting is a mix of natural light from high windows and industrial LED lighting, creating a professional, operational atmosphere. No text or holograms in the image. Focus on the collaboration and the industrial equipment.

2026-02-17 11:34:17,909 - INFO - Generating image with prompt: A photorealistic, cinematic wide shot inside a modern manufacturing facility. The scene features a diverse group of reliability engineers and maintenance technicians (men and women) wearing standard PPE including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. They are standing near a large industrial conveyor system. One technician is holding a ruggedized tablet, but the back of the tablet is facing the camera (screen not visible). In the background, subtle, glowing digital lines (representing data flow) connect the machinery to the ceiling, symbolizing the "nervous system" of the factory, but the effect should be subtle and blended with the realistic lighting. The lighting is professional, industrial cool tones with warm highlights on the people. No text or words in the image. High resolution, 8k.

One technician is holding a tablet (back of the device visible only) pointing toward the machine, suggesting digital scanning or data entry. The background shows a clean, busy factory floor with conveyors and automated machinery. The lighting is bright and industrial. No text or words should be visible in the image. The mood is professional, collaborative, and technologically advanced.

2026-02-17 12:29:52,972 - INFO - Generating image with prompt: A high-resolution, photo-realistic hero image of a modern industrial manufacturing floor. In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are collaborating. They are wearing full PPE, including white hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility orange vests. One technician is holding an industrial tablet, but only the back of the device is visible to the camera. They are standing next to a large, heavy-duty hydraulic scissor lift and a series of overhead conveyors. The background shows a clean, well-lit brownfield factory environment with a mix of older machinery and modern sensors. The focus is on the professional collaboration and the scale of the material handling equipment. No text or screens are visible. Full body shots of the workers.

In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are wearing clean, high-visibility vests, hard hats, and safety glasses. They are standing near a heavy-duty industrial shelving unit where several organized "kits" (clear, durable bins containing mechanical parts like gears, bearings, and gaskets) are neatly arranged. One technician is holding a ruggedized tablet (showing only the back of the device) while pointing toward a specific kit. The background shows a well-lit, clean manufacturing floor with large-scale machinery, suggesting a high-tech "brownfield" environment. The lighting is bright and professional, emphasizing a sense of organized efficiency and safety. No text or logos are visible on any surfaces. Full-body shots of the professionals are shown.

In the foreground, a diverse team of two maintenance professionals (one male, one female) are collaborating. They are wearing full PPE, including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility orange vests over work clothes. One person is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet (viewed from the back, no screen visible), while the other points toward a large, well-maintained industrial motor assembly on a "brownfield" production line. The background shows a clean, organized factory environment with conveyors and overhead piping, softly blurred to keep focus on the professionals. The lighting is bright and natural for an industrial setting. Full-body view of the workers. No text or logos visible.

2026-02-17 16:10:57,472 - INFO - Generating image with prompt: A high-resolution, photo-realistic hero image of a modern industrial manufacturing floor. In the foreground, a diverse pair of maintenance professionals (one male, one female) are standing near a large, well-maintained centrifugal pump and motor assembly. They are wearing full professional PPE, including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility orange vests over work shirts. One professional is holding a ruggedized industrial tablet; the viewer sees only the back of the tablet, which is a matte black protective case. They are looking at the machinery and discussing a maintenance task. The background shows a clean, organized factory environment with overhead conveyors and various stainless steel pipes. The lighting is bright and professional, suggesting a safe and efficient workplace. No text or logos are visible on the equipment or clothing. Full body shots of the professionals are included.

2026-02-17 16:25:28,748 - INFO - Generating image with prompt: A wide-angle, photo-realistic shot of a modern, clean industrial manufacturing floor. In the foreground, a diverse team of three maintenance professionals—a man in his 40s, a woman in her 30s, and a younger man—are standing near a large, complex industrial motor. They are all wearing full PPE, including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility orange vests over work shirts. One technician is pointing toward a specific part of the machinery while another holds a ruggedized industrial tablet; the tablet is held so only its black protective back is visible to the camera. The lighting is bright and professional, highlighting the polished concrete floor and the well-maintained equipment. There are no words, logos, or text visible on any surfaces. The focus is on the collaborative, high-tech nature of modern industrial maintenance.

They are wearing full PPE, including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility neon vests. The maintenance manager is holding a rugged industrial tablet (viewed from the back, no screen visible) while they all look toward a large, complex piece of industrial machinery (a robotic assembly arm or a large compressor) in the background. The lighting is bright and cinematic, emphasizing a "brownfield-modern" aesthetic where clean, new technology integrates with established industrial infrastructure. Full-body shot, no text or logos visible.

In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are standing near a large industrial pump assembly. They are wearing clean, professional PPE including white hard hats, clear safety glasses, and high-visibility yellow vests. One technician is holding a ruggedized tablet, showing only the black back of the device to the camera. They are pointing toward a sensor mounted on the pump, appearing to be in a collaborative discussion. The background shows a clean, well-lit factory environment with various pipes and machinery, slightly out of focus to emphasize the personnel. No text or logos are visible on the equipment or clothing. Full-body shots showing the team standing on a polished concrete floor with yellow safety markings.

2026-02-17 20:07:16,242 - INFO - Generating image with prompt: A wide-angle, photo-realistic shot of a clean, modern mid-sized manufacturing floor. In the foreground, a diverse group of three maintenance professionals (one woman, two men) are standing near a large industrial motor and pump assembly. They are wearing clean hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One professional is pointing toward the machinery while another holds a ruggedized industrial tablet (showing only the back of the device). The background shows a well-organized production line with conveyors and overhead structures. The lighting is bright and professional, emphasizing a high-tech, efficient industrial environment. No text or logos are visible on the equipment or clothing. Full body shots of the professionals are visible.
