2025-08-06 12:01:42,341 - INFO - Generating image with prompt: A photorealistic, professional image set in a clean, modern factory control room. A diverse team of three people—a middle-aged Caucasian male maintenance manager in a hard hat, a young Asian female engineer in safety glasses, and a Black male technician in his 30s wearing a high-visibility vest—are gathered around a large industrial tablet held by the manager. The manager is pointing at the screen, which displays complex graphs and a 3D model of a machine (no text visible). The engineer is looking thoughtfully at the screen, and the technician is looking over her shoulder towards a large pump and motor assembly visible in the background through a window. The lighting is bright and professional, with a slightly shallow depth of field that keeps the focus on the collaborative team and the technology. The overall mood is proactive, data-driven, and technologically advanced.

In a clean, brightly lit, modern factory, a diverse team of two maintenance professionals, a Hispanic male and a Black female, are collaborating. The male technician holds a ruggedized tablet displaying a complex vibration analysis graph (FFT spectrum) without any text. He is pointing at a specific peak on the screen, discussing it with the female engineer. The female engineer is looking intently at a large, clean industrial gearbox that is the focus of their attention. A small, wireless IIoT sensor is visibly mounted on the gearbox's bearing housing. Both are wearing professional work attire with high-visibility vests, safety glasses, and hard hats. The background is softly blurred, showing other advanced manufacturing equipment. The overall mood is professional, high-tech, and collaborative. Cinematic lighting with a slight blue and orange color grade.

In the foreground, a diverse team of three maintenance professionals—a middle-aged white man, a young Black woman, and an Asian man in his 40s—are gathered around a large, ruggedized tablet. They are all wearing hard hats and safety glasses. The woman is pointing to a complex graph on the tablet screen, which displays vibration data and an AI-generated health score for a piece of equipment. In the background, large screens show a digital twin of the plant with a rotary kiln and crushers highlighted. The lighting is bright and professional, conveying a sense of high-tech competence and collaboration.

A male maintenance manager of South Asian descent is holding a tablet displaying a clear predictive maintenance alert and a vibration waveform. He is discussing it with a female technician of Caucasian descent, who is pointing to a wireless sensor on a large stainless steel industrial mixer. A younger male technician of African descent is observing the tablet with interest. All three are wearing appropriate PPE: white hairnets, safety glasses, and clean, blue company uniforms. The background shows other stainless steel equipment under bright, clean lighting, with a slight depth of field to keep the focus on the team and their interaction with the technology. The image should be free of any text or logos.

A diverse team of three people—a Black woman, an East Asian man, and a Caucasian man—are collaborating. The woman is a maintenance manager pointing at a large, wall-mounted digital screen displaying complex machinery data: colorful vibration waveforms (FFT spectrums) and a thermal heatmap of a motor. The East Asian man, a data scientist, holds a tablet showing similar data. The Caucasian man, a senior technician, looks from the screen towards a large, pristine electric motor and pump assembly in the mid-ground. All are wearing appropriate PPE: hard hats, safety glasses, and professional work attire. The image conveys collaboration, high technology, and human expertise working together. The lighting is bright and optimistic, with a shallow depth of field focusing on the team and the screen. No text on the image.

A diverse team of two maintenance technicians, one male of South Asian descent and one female of Caucasian descent, are collaborating in front of a complex piece of industrial machinery. Both are wearing appropriate PPE: safety glasses, hard hats, and professional work uniforms. The female technician is holding a ruggedized tablet displaying graphs and data (no text visible), pointing to a specific point on the screen. The male technician is looking at the screen and then at a specific component on the machine, a thoughtful and engaged expression on his face. The background is slightly blurred to focus on the team, but other clean machinery and good lighting are visible. The overall mood is professional, proactive, and collaborative problem-solving, not an emergency repair.

2025-08-06 14:53:26,144 - INFO - Generating image with prompt: A photorealistic, high-quality professional image for a manufacturing blog post. The setting is a clean, bright, and modern factory floor. In the foreground, a diverse team of three people—a male maintenance manager of South Asian descent in his 40s, a female engineer of Caucasian descent in her 30s, and a younger male technician of African descent in his 20s—are gathered around a ruggedized tablet held by the manager. They are all wearing appropriate PPE: hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests over their work clothes. They are looking at the tablet, which displays graphs and data, and appear to be engaged in a collaborative discussion. In the background, slightly out of focus, is a large, complex piece of automated machinery with some visible motors and conveyor belts, suggesting a high-tech industrial environment. The lighting is bright and professional, creating a sense of optimism and technological advancement. The image should have no text.

A female maintenance manager of Hispanic descent and a male reliability engineer of Asian descent, both in their 30s-40s and wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests, are standing in front of a large, slightly older piece of industrial machinery (like a stamping press or a CNC machine). The manager is holding a ruggedized tablet that displays colorful graphs and data analytics. They are both looking at the tablet and pointing towards the machine, engaged in a collaborative discussion. The lighting is bright and professional, highlighting the contrast between the modern technology (the tablet) and the legacy equipment. The background is slightly blurred to keep the focus on the people and the machine. There is no text on the image.

The setting is a clean, modern, well-lit manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a junior female technician of Hispanic descent and a senior male technician of African descent are collaborating over a complex piece of industrial machinery. The junior technician holds a ruggedized tablet that displays a 3D model of the machine's internals with glowing data points. The senior technician is pointing to a physical component on the machine, which corresponds to the highlighted area on the tablet. Both are wearing appropriate PPE: safety glasses, hard hats, and company-branded work shirts. The background is slightly blurred, showing other machinery and conveying a sense of a large, operational space. The lighting is bright and optimistic, with a slight lens flare to give it a modern, tech-forward feel. There is no text on the image.

2025-08-06 18:16:50,627 - INFO - Generating image with prompt: A high-quality, photorealistic hero image for a blog post about modern CMMS. The setting is a bright, clean, and modern manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a diverse team of two maintenance professionals, a woman with dark hair in a ponytail and a man of South Asian descent, are collaborating. The woman is holding a ruggedized tablet displaying a clean user interface with charts and data (no text visible), representing a mobile CMMS app. The man is pointing to a sensor on a large, modern electric motor that is part of a clean conveyor system in the background. Both are wearing appropriate PPE: safety glasses, high-visibility vests over their work clothes, and hard hats. The lighting is bright and professional, with a slight depth of field blurring the background to keep the focus on the people and technology. The overall mood is one of collaboration, efficiency, and advanced technology in an industrial setting.
