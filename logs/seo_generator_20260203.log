In the foreground, a diverse group of industrial engineers and maintenance technicians (wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-vis vests) are collaborating. One engineer is holding a tablet (back facing camera) pointing toward a complex conveyor system, while a technician points at a specific component. In the background, automated machinery and robotic arms are in motion. The lighting is bright and industrial, with a cool blue and steel color palette. The image conveys collaboration, precision, and modern technology. No text or overlays.

They are wearing appropriate PPE: hard hats with face shields lifted, safety glasses, high-visibility vests over arc-rated clothing (FR shirts), and voltage-rated gloves. The female engineer is holding a tablet (back of device visible) referencing a digital schematic, while the male engineer points to a warning label on the equipment. The background shows rows of industrial electrical distribution equipment, clean and well-lit with cool LED lighting, conveying a sense of high-tech safety and maintenance standards. Depth of field focuses on the workers and the panel they are inspecting. No text or words visible in the image.

In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers (men and women) wearing hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests are inspecting a large industrial motor. One engineer is holding a generic industrial tablet (back facing the camera) while pointing at a wireless sensor mounted on the machinery. The background shows a depth of field with automated conveyors and soft, cool industrial lighting. The atmosphere is professional, high-tech, and focused on precision. No text or logos visible.

In the foreground, a diverse group of reliability engineers (men and women) wearing standard mining PPE (orange high-vis vests, hard hats with ear muffs attached, safety glasses) are looking at a ruggedized tablet held by one of them (back of tablet visible only). They are standing near a large conveyor belt system. In the background, massive crushing equipment and yellow haul trucks are visible in the distance. The lighting is a mix of natural sunlight and industrial LED lighting. Superimposed subtly in the air near the machinery are holographic-style data visualizations (graphs, heatmaps) representing the "digital twin" aspect, but kept realistic and not overly sci-fi. The atmosphere is professional, high-tech, and industrial.

2026-02-03 16:26:58,342 - INFO - Generating image with prompt: A photo-realistic, high-quality image set in a modern industrial manufacturing facility. The focus is on a diverse group of maintenance technicians wearing full PPE (hard hats, safety glasses, high-visibility vests, and gloves). In the foreground, a technician is physically applying a red safety padlock and a warning tag to a large, industrial yellow ball valve lockout device on a pipe. Another technician stands slightly behind, holding a tablet (showing only the back of the device) to reference a digital checklist. The background features blurred industrial machinery, conveying a sense of a busy but organized factory floor. The lighting is bright and professional, highlighting the safety equipment. No text or words should be visible in the image.
