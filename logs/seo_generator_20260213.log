In the foreground, a diverse group of maintenance professionals (a mix of ages and genders) are gathered around a large industrial motor. They are wearing full PPE including hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests. One technician is holding a rugged tablet, but the screen is not visible to the viewer; they are looking at the motor, not the screen. In the background, slightly out of focus, are automated conveyor lines and robotic arms in motion. The lighting is a mix of cool industrial LED and warm accent lighting on the machinery, creating a professional, high-tech atmosphere. No text or overlays. The mood is collaborative and focused.

In the foreground, a diverse group of industrial professionals (a plant manager in a blazer and hard hat, and a maintenance technician in a blue uniform and safety glasses) are looking at a tablet held by the technician. The back of the tablet is visible, not the screen. They are standing next to a large, complex piece of industrial machinery (perhaps a conveyor system or a large pump) that has a small, glowing wireless sensor attached to it. The background is slightly blurred but shows a busy, high-tech factory floor with yellow safety lines and automated equipment.

In the foreground, a diverse maintenance technician (wearing a hard hat, safety glasses, and high-vis vest) is viewed from behind/over-the-shoulder. They are holding a rugged industrial tablet. The focus is on the technician and the machinery in front of them (perhaps a large conveyor system or automated assembly arm), not the screen of the tablet. The background shows a bustling but organized factory floor with other workers in PPE. The lighting is professional, mixing cool industrial LED lighting with warm highlights on the machinery. The image conveys technology, safety, and efficiency. No text or overlays.
