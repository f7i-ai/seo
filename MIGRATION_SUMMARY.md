## 🚧 Next Steps Required

### 1. Update API Key (Critical)

You need to update your `.env` file with your actual Prismic API key:

```bash
# Replace 'your-prismic-api-key-here' with your actual token
PRISMIC_API_KEY=your-actual-prismic-write-token
```

**How to get your API key:**
1. Go to [https://factory-ai.prismic.io/settings/apps/](https://factory-ai.prismic.io/settings/apps/)
2. Create a new "Permanent Access Token"
3. Give it **Master API** write access
4. Copy the token to your `.env` file

### 2. Verify Prismic Setup

Ensure your Prismic repository has:

- **Blog Custom Type** with:
  - `meta_title` (Text)
  - `meta_description` (Text)
  - `meta_image` (Image)
  - `slices` (Slice Zone)

- **Required Slices:**
  - `title_and_body` slice
  - `profile_tim` slice

### 3. Run Migration

Once your API key is updated:

```bash
# Test with single document first
npm run test-migrate

# Then run full migration
npm run migrate
```

## 🎯 Migration Results

After successful migration, you'll have:

- **24 blog documents** in your Prismic repository
- **SEO-optimized content** with proper meta tags
- **Rich text formatting** preserved from markdown
- **Featured images** (where available)
- **Tim Cheung profile** section on each post
- **Search-friendly URLs** based on titles

## 📋 Scripts Available

- `npm run test-migrate` - Test migration with single document
- `npm run migrate` - Full migration of all content
- `npm run migrate-all` - Same as `npm run migrate`

## 🔍 Current Status

- ✅ **Migration Scripts**: Complete and tested
- ✅ **Content Processing**: 24 documents processed successfully
- ✅ **Rich Text Conversion**: Working correctly
- ✅ **Document Structure**: Proper slices and metadata
- ⚠️ **API Authentication**: Requires valid API key
- ⚠️ **Image URLs**: Some may be expired (fallback implemented)

## 🚀 Expected Outcome

Once you update the API key and run the migration, you'll have all 24 SEO-optimized blog posts in your Prismic repository, ready for publication on your website.

## 💡 Tips

1. **Test First**: Always run `npm run test-migrate` before the full migration
2. **Monitor Progress**: The scripts provide detailed logging
3. **Check Results**: Review documents in Prismic after migration
4. **Publish**: Remember to publish the documents in Prismic (they're created as drafts)

The migration system is ready to go - just update your API key and run it!
