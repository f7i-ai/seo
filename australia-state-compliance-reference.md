# Australia state compliance wording reference

Use this when creating Australia-focused content or long-tail keywords that reference state regulators.

## National

- **Work Health and Safety (WHS)** -- model laws adopted by most states/territories.
- **Safe Work Australia** -- national policy body (not a regulator). Sets model codes of practice.
- **PCBU** (Person Conducting a Business or Undertaking) -- the duty holder under WHS law (replaces the US concept of "employer" in OSHA).
- **Officers** -- company directors / senior leaders have a positive duty of due diligence under WHS Act s.27.

## State and territory regulators

| State / Territory  | Regulator name       | Notes |
|--------------------|----------------------|-------|
| NSW                | SafeWork NSW         | Adopted WHS Act 2011 |
| Victoria           | WorkSafe Victoria    | Uses OHS Act 2004 (not the model WHS Act); terminology differs |
| Queensland         | WorkSafe Queensland  | Strong mining-specific regulations via Resources Safety & Health Queensland |
| Western Australia  | WorkSafe WA          | Adopted WHS Act from 2022; previously separate regime |
| South Australia    | SafeWork SA          | Adopted WHS Act 2012 |
| Tasmania           | WorkSafe Tasmania    | Adopted WHS Act 2012 |

## Key differences by state (relevant to maintenance content)

- **Victoria** uses "OHS" not "WHS". References should cite the *Occupational Health and Safety Act 2004* and *OHS Regulations 2017*, not the model WHS Act.
- **Queensland** has separate mining safety legislation (Mining and Quarrying Safety and Health Act 1999; Coal Mining Safety and Health Act 1999). Mining maintenance content for QLD should reference these.
- **Western Australia** transitioned to the model WHS Act in March 2022. Some older guidance references the *Occupational Safety and Health Act 1984* (now repealed). Mining in WA has separate regulations under the *Mines Safety and Inspection Act 1994* (now replaced by *Work Health and Safety (Mines) Regulations 2022*).
- **SWMS** (Safe Work Method Statements) are only legally required for "high risk construction work" as defined in WHS Regulations. However, many PCBUs use them for maintenance work voluntarily. The distinction matters for compliance content.

## Usage in keywords and content

- National compliance: use "WHS" and "Australia" (e.g. "WHS maintenance requirements Australia").
- State compliance: use regulator name for authority (e.g. "SafeWork NSW maintenance compliance requirements").
- Victoria: use "OHS" not "WHS" when referencing Victorian legislation specifically.
- Mining content for QLD/WA: reference state-specific mining safety legislation.
- SWMS content: clarify that SWMS is legally mandated for high risk construction work; voluntary but best practice for other maintenance.

## Australian English spelling

Use in all Australia-targeted content:
- optimisation, organisation, behaviour, colour, labour, centre, licence (noun), defence, analyse, customise, prioritise, visualisation.
- "Reliability centred maintenance" (not centered).
